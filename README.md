```

Then **restart OpenCode** to load the agents.

## Overview

Four agents covering the full development cycle:

| Agent | When to use |
|---|---|
| `b-plan` | Think before coding — task decomposition, approach evaluation, plan file |
| `b-research` | All external knowledge — library docs, comparisons, multi-source research |
| `b-debug` | Full-loop debugging — trace, confirm root cause, fix, verify |
| `b-review` | Pre-PR review — logic, requirements, edge cases, test adequacy |

**Typical flow:**
```
b-plan → [implement manually] → b-review → commit
b-research  (any time you need docs or comparisons)
b-debug     (any time something breaks)
```

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for full details — triggers, output format, rules, and agent distinctions.
