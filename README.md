# b-agent-skills

A personal skill suite for Claude Code, organized into two groups:

- **Development skills** — a tightly integrated pipeline for software development work, leveraging all 5 MCPs
- **Personal / daily skills** — standalone utilities for everyday personal use

---

## MCP dependencies

| MCP | Role |
|---|---|
| `context7` | Fetch live, version-accurate docs for any library or SDK |
| `brave-search` | Real web search beyond training data cutoff |
| `firecrawl` | Scrape full page content, not just search snippets |
| `jcodemunch` | Analyze code structure, call graphs, and complexity |
| `sequential-thinking` | Structured reasoning and task decomposition |

All 5 MCPs must be connected. Verify with `/mcp` in Claude Code.

## Skills overview

### Development skills

| Skill | MCP(s) | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| [`b-plan`](#b-plan) | sequential-thinking | Before writing code for any non-trivial task |
| [`b-docs`](#b-docs) | context7 | Before using any library or SDK |
| [`b-research`](#b-research) | brave-search, firecrawl, context7 | Deep research, tool comparison, synthesis |
| [`b-analyze`](#b-analyze) | jcodemunch | Understand or review code before changing it |
| [`b-debug`](#b-debug) | jcodemunch, sequential-thinking | Trace bugs that have no obvious cause |
| [`b-feature`](#b-feature) | all of the above | Full pipeline for complex feature development |

### Personal / daily skills

| Skill | MCP(s) | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| [`b-quick-search`](#b-quick-search) | brave-search | Quick one-call web lookup for current info |
| [`b-news`](#b-news) | brave-search, firecrawl | Daily tech news digest |
| [`b-sync`](#b-sync) | — | Sync skills from GitHub repo to any machine |

## Installation

Copy each skill folder into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
# Option A — manual copy
cp -r b-plan b-docs b-research b-analyze b-debug b-feature b-quick-search b-news b-sync ~/.claude/skills/

# Option B — use b-sync (recommended, keeps skills up to date automatically)
git clone https://github.com/dhoaibao/b-agent-skills.git ~/.b-agent-skills && bash ~/.b-agent-skills/sync.sh
```

Verify all MCPs are connected:
```
/mcp
```

All 5 must show `✓ Connected`:
`context7`, `brave-search`, `firecrawl`, `jcodemunch`, `sequential-thinking`
