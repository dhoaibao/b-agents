  Static observability audit — find missing log statements, swallowed errors, missing
  metrics instrumentation, and absent tracing context propagation in source code.
  ALWAYS use when the user says "observability", "logging gaps", "missing logs", "kiểm tra log",
  "tìm lỗi bị nuốt", "tracing", "metrics coverage", or "audit instrumentation".
  Distinct from b-analyze (general quality) and b-debug (runtime failures): b-observe
  targets instrumentation completeness, not code structure or live system behavior.

# b-observe

Audit source code for observability gaps — statically, without running the system.
Surfaces missing log statements, silently swallowed errors, absent metrics instrumentation,
and missing tracing context propagation so they can be fixed before they hide incidents.

## When to use

- Before a production deploy: verify critical paths are instrumented.
- During code review: check that new code carries logging, error reporting, and tracing.
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar service: map what is and isn't observable.
- User says: "observability audit", "find missing logs", "kiểm tra log", "tìm lỗi bị nuốt", "tracing coverage".

## When NOT to use

- Runtime performance profiling (CPU, memory, latency measurements) — requires a live system → use a profiler.
- Structured log format validation (log levels, schema) — that's a lint concern → use b-gate.
- General code quality review → use **b-analyze**.
- Something is broken right now → use **b-debug**.

## Tools required

From `jcodemunch` MCP server:
- `resolve_repo`, `index_folder` — index or resolve the local codebase before querying.
- `search_text` — find log/trace/metric call patterns and detect their absence in error handlers.
- `find_references` — find all usages of logger, tracer, and metrics objects to map instrumented vs uninstrumented call sites.
- `get_symbol_source` — read full source of error handlers, request handlers, and service entry points.
- `get_file_outline` — batch-inspect files for function signatures to identify all error-handling functions.
- `get_repo_outline` — understand module structure to scope the audit.

From `sequential-thinking` MCP server *(optional)*:
- `sequentialthinking` — prioritize findings by impact and produce an ordered remediation list.

If jcodemunch is unavailable: use `Grep` to search for log/trace patterns and `Read` to inspect error handlers directly. Note limitation: cross-file reference tracking will be incomplete — flag this in the report.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — Grep/Read can cover most patterns. jcodemunch improves completeness of reference tracking. sequential-thinking improves prioritization. Both optional.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Define audit scope

Confirm:
- **Target**: specific service, module, or layer (e.g., "the payment service", "all HTTP handlers", "background job workers").
- **Stack**: what logging, metrics, and tracing libraries are in use? (e.g., `winston`, `structlog`, `zap`, `OpenTelemetry`, `Prometheus`).

If the user says "audit everything" without further context, ask which service or layer matters most — a full-repo audit produces noise on large codebases.

Use `resolve_repo` first. If no match, call `index_folder` with the project root and `use_ai_summaries: false`. Then call `get_repo_outline` to understand module layout before narrowing scope.

---

### Step 2 — Detect instrumentation libraries

Before auditing gaps, identify what's available:

**Logging** — search for import patterns:
```
search_text(query="import.*logger|require.*logger|import.*log |from.*logging|import.*winston|import.*pino|import.*zap|import.*structlog", is_regex=true)
```

**Metrics** — search for:
```
search_text(query="prometheus|statsd|metrics\.|counter\.|histogram\.|gauge\.", is_regex=true)
```

**Tracing** — search for:
```
search_text(query="opentelemetry|tracer\.|startSpan|trace\.|context\.with|propagat", is_regex=true)
```

For each found library, use `find_references` on the primary logger/tracer/metrics symbol to map which files are instrumented. Files with zero references to any instrumentation library are candidates for Step 3.

---

### Step 3 — Find missing log statements

**Error handlers with no log call** — these swallow failures silently:

Use `search_text` to locate all catch/except blocks:
```
search_text(query="catch\s*\(|except\s+|rescue\s+|\.catch\(", is_regex=true)
```

For each match, use `get_symbol_source` with `context_lines=5` to read the surrounding handler body. Flag blocks where:
- The body contains only a re-throw (`throw e`, `raise`) with no log call before it.
- The body is empty or contains only a comment.
- The body calls `console.error` / `print` instead of the structured logger (degrades observability).

**Entry and exit of critical operations** — check request handlers, job processors, and external service calls for missing start/end log events:

```
search_text(query="async function|def handle|func Handle|public.*Controller|@PostMapping|@app\.(get|post|put|delete)", is_regex=true)
```

For each match, check if the function body contains at least one log call.

---

### Step 4 — Find missing metrics instrumentation

Identify paths that should increment a counter or record a histogram but don't:

1. Find all HTTP handlers, job handlers, and external API call sites using `get_file_outline`.
2. For each handler: use `get_symbol_source` and check whether the function body calls a metrics increment/observe/record function.
3. Flag handlers that process requests or complete work without recording any metric.

Common missing points:
- Request count / error count per endpoint.
- Job success / failure counters.
- External dependency call durations.
- Queue depth or processing lag.

---

### Step 5 — Find missing tracing context propagation

If a tracing library was detected in Step 2:

1. Use `find_references` on the tracer/span symbols to list all instrumented functions.
2. Use `get_file_outline` on service-boundary files (HTTP handlers, message consumers, scheduled jobs) — these should always start a trace span.
3. Flag service entry points that don't call `startSpan` / `trace.getTracer` / equivalent.
4. Use `search_text` to find context propagation patterns (HTTP header injection/extraction):
   ```
   search_text(query="traceparent|W3C|propagat|inject|extract|carrier", is_regex=true)
   ```
   Flag HTTP clients that do not inject trace context into outgoing requests.

---

### Step 6 — Prioritize and report

If sequential-thinking is available, call `sequentialthinking` with:
> "Given these observability gaps [list from Steps 3–5], rank the top 5 by incident impact. Which gaps would cause the most confusion during an outage — where would an on-call engineer be flying blind?"

Use the result to produce an **Ordered remediation list** at the top of Recommended Next Steps.

## Output format

```
### b-observe: [target — service, module, or layer]

**Scope**: [files/modules audited]
**Stack detected**: [logging lib] / [metrics lib] / [tracing lib] / [none detected]

---

**Missing log statements**

🔴 High — [function]: [file:line] — catch block with no log call → add `logger.error(err)` before re-throw or return
🟡 Medium — [function]: [file:line] — silent null return on error path → add `logger.warn(...)` with context
🟢 Low — [function]: [file:line] — uses `console.error` instead of structured logger → replace with `logger.error`

**Missing metrics**

🔴 High — [handler]: [file:line] — HTTP 5xx path not counted → add error counter increment
🟡 Medium — [handler]: [file:line] — job completion not recorded → add success/failure counter

**Missing tracing**

🔴 High — [entry point]: [file:line] — no span started on inbound request → add `tracer.startActiveSpan(...)`
🟡 Medium — [http client call]: [file:line] — trace context not injected into outgoing request headers

**Metrics snapshot**
- Functions audited: N
- Functions with no log: N (N%)
- Functions with no metric: N (N%)
- Entry points with no trace span: N

## Rules

- **Static only**: never suggest runtime profiling, live log sampling, or APM configuration — those require live systems. Flag them as out of scope.
- **Findings must be specific**: file + function + reason, not "logging is missing everywhere".
- **Don't fix during audit**: this skill produces a findings report. Hand off to b-plan for remediation sequencing.
- **Scope before auditing**: always confirm target layer or service first — a full-repo scan on a large project produces noise.
- **Distinguish swallowed errors from re-thrown**: a handler that re-throws without logging is a gap, but less severe than one that returns without logging — note the difference in severity.
- **console.log is not structured logging**: flag `console.log/error/warn` as Medium (not High) — it's observable, but degrades log quality in production.
- **If no instrumentation library detected**: flag this as 🔴 High at the top of the report — the service has zero observability, not just gaps.
- Never trigger destructive git commands — no `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, `git checkout -- <file>`, or `git branch -D`. If a commit is needed after completing work, delegate to b-commit.
