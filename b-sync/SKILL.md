description: Sync, update, or bootstrap Claude skills from the b-agent-skills GitHub repo.

# b-sync

Syncs Claude skills from the public `b-agent-skills` GitHub repo to `~/.claude/skills/` using git + HTTPS. No extra tools required — just `git`.

## How it works

- `~/.b-agent-skills/` — local clone of the repo (source of truth)
- `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>` — symlinks pointing into the clone
- Updating = `git pull` → symlinks stay valid automatically
- Stale symlinks (skills removed from repo) are cleaned up automatically on each sync

## Commands

### Bootstrap a new machine (first time only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhoaibao/b-agent-skills.git ~/.b-agent-skills && bash ~/.b-agent-skills/sync.sh
```

### Sync / update skills (everyday use)

```bash
bash ~/.b-agent-skills/sync.sh
```

This will:
1. `git pull` the latest changes from the repo
2. Re-symlink any new skill folders into `~/.claude/skills/`
3. Remove symlinks for skills that no longer exist in the repo

## What sync.sh does (for reference)

- Pulls latest from `main`
- Scans all root-level folders in the repo
- Symlinks folders that contain a `SKILL.md` into `~/.claude/skills/`
- Removes stale symlinks for skills deleted from the repo
- Skips anything without a `SKILL.md` (e.g. `sync.sh` itself, `README.md`)
- Safe to re-run anytime — idempotent

## Adding a new skill to the repo

1. Create a folder at the root of `b-agent-skills/`: `mkdir my-skill`
2. Add `my-skill/SKILL.md` with proper frontmatter
3. Commit and push
4. Run `~/.b-agent-skills/sync.sh` on any machine to pick it up

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Permission denied` | Check your network or GitHub token if repo requires auth |
| Skill not showing in Claude Code | Check folder has `SKILL.md` with valid `name` + `description` frontmatter |
| Symlink broken | Re-run `sync.sh` to refresh |
