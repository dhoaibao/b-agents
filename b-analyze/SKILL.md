  Deep code analysis using jcodemunch — map structure, measure complexity, find
  duplicate logic, and produce actionable improvement suggestions.
  ALWAYS use this skill when the user says "analyze", "review this code", "phân tích",
  "code review", "refactor", "dọn dẹp code", "tìm code smell", "cải thiện code",
  "tái cấu trúc", "làm sao cải thiện", or when asked to understand an unfamiliar
  codebase before making changes. Also use before any significant refactor to establish
  a baseline. Distinct from b-debug — use b-analyze when there is no bug to fix,
  only code to understand or improve.

# b-analyze

Understand code before changing it. Use jcodemunch to map structure, measure quality,
and surface concrete improvements — not vague suggestions.

## When to use

- Before a refactor: understand what exists before changing it
- Code review: assess quality, consistency, and maintainability
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase or module
- Identifying duplicate logic, high-complexity hotspots, or inconsistent patterns
- User says: "analyze", "review", "phân tích code", "refactor", "tìm code smell"

**Difference from b-debug**: b-analyze is for code that works but could be better.
b-debug is for code that is broken. If there's an error message → use b-debug instead.

## Tools required

From `jcodemunch` MCP server:
- `index_repo` / `index_folder` — index the codebase before querying
- `get_repo_outline` — overview of all modules, files, and top-level symbols
- `get_file_outline` — functions, classes, and exports per file
- `get_dependency_graph` — module coupling and circular dependency detection
- `search_symbols` — find duplicate or similarly-named functions across files

If jcodemunch is unavailable: read files manually, reason about structure inline.
Note the limitation — manual reading may miss cross-file dependencies.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Define analysis scope

Clarify what to analyze and why:

- **Target**: specific file, directory, module, or layer (e.g. "the service layer", "all route handlers")
- **Goal**: what decision will this analysis inform? (refactor, code review, onboarding, pre-feature audit)
- **Depth**: quick overview vs deep structural analysis

If the user says "analyze the whole project" without further context, ask which layer or
concern matters most — analyzing everything produces noise.

---

### Step 2 — Structural analysis

Use `jcodemunch` to map the target code in this order:

1. `index_repo` (or `index_folder` for a subdirectory) — index the codebase first
2. `get_repo_outline` — overview of all modules, files, and top-level symbols
3. `get_file_outline` — inspect each relevant file for functions, classes, and exports
4. `get_dependency_graph` — map module coupling; look for circular deps and tight coupling
5. `search_symbols` — find duplicate or similarly-named functions across files

From these, extract:
- **Call graph**: what calls what, entry points, leaf functions
- **Dependency map**: which modules depend on which, circular dependencies
- **File/module boundaries**: what's responsible for what
- **Size distribution**: unusually large files or functions are complexity hotspots

Goal: build a mental model of the code's shape before evaluating its quality.

---

### Step 3 — Quality analysis

With the structure mapped, evaluate:

**Complexity**
- Functions or methods with high cyclomatic complexity (flag anything >10)
- Deeply nested conditionals or loops
- Long functions that do more than one thing

**Duplication**
- Similar logic appearing in multiple places
- Copy-pasted error handling, validation, or transformation code
- Inconsistent patterns for the same concern (e.g. 3 different ways to handle errors)

**Cohesion & coupling**
- Modules that know too much about each other
- Single files/classes doing too many unrelated things
- Cross-layer violations (e.g. DB queries inside route handlers)

**Maintainability signals**
- Missing or misleading names (variables, functions, files)
- Magic numbers or hardcoded values that should be constants
- Dead code — functions defined but never called

---

### Step 4 — Produce findings

Organize findings by severity:

- **🔴 High**: causes maintenance burden now, or will cause bugs soon (circular deps, very high complexity, cross-layer violations)
- **🟡 Medium**: technical debt that slows down development (duplication, inconsistent patterns, large functions)
- **🟢 Low**: nice-to-have improvements (naming, minor reorganization)

For each finding:
- State exactly what was found and where (file, function, line range if relevant)
- Explain why it's a problem — not just "this is bad"
- Suggest a concrete improvement — not just "refactor this"

---

### Step 5 — Recommend next actions

Based on findings, suggest:

- If refactor is needed → hand off to `b-plan` to sequence the refactor safely
- If a specific pattern is broken → flag which functions need fixing and in what order
- If complexity is concentrated in one area → suggest splitting it first before any other changes
- If findings are minor → list them as a backlog, not urgent action

## Output format

```
### Analysis: [target — file, module, or layer]

**Scope**: [what was analyzed]
**Goal**: [what decision this informs]

---

**Structure overview**
[Call graph or module map — brief, not exhaustive]
[Key entry points, main dependencies]

---

**Findings**

🔴 High priority
- [Finding]: [where] — [why it's a problem] → [concrete suggestion]

🟡 Medium priority
- [Finding]: [where] — [why it's a problem] → [concrete suggestion]

🟢 Low priority
- [Finding]: [where] — [suggestion]

---

**Metrics snapshot**
- Highest complexity: `[function]` — cyclomatic complexity [N]
- Largest file: `[file]` — [N] lines
- Duplication detected: [yes/no — where]
- Circular dependencies: [yes/no — which]

---

**Recommended next steps**
1. [Most impactful action first]
2. ...

*Use `b-plan` to sequence the refactor if proceeding.*
```

## Rules

- Never suggest a refactor without first understanding the full structure — partial analysis leads to wrong recommendations
- Findings must be specific: file + function + reason, not "this module is messy"
- Every High finding must have a concrete suggestion, not just a complaint
- Don't fix anything during analysis — this skill produces findings, not changes
- If analysis reveals a bug (broken logic, not just poor style) → note it and suggest switching to `b-debug`
- Keep Low findings in the report but don't let them dominate — focus on what actually matters
- After outputting findings, always recommend whether to proceed with `b-plan` or if the code is healthy enough to modify directly
