  Fetch live, version-accurate documentation from Context7 before implementing anything
  that involves a library, SDK, framework, or third-party tool.
  ALWAYS use this skill when the user mentions a specific library or package by name
  (e.g. SendGrid, BullMQ, Prisma, Zod, Express, AWS SES, Mailgun, Stripe, Axios),
  asks "how to use X", "X API", "X method", "does X support Y", or before writing
  any integration code. Use this even when you think you already know the API —
  training data may be outdated. Never implement library code from memory alone.

# b-docs

Fetch versioned, accurate documentation from Context7 before writing any library or
SDK code. Prevents hallucinated APIs, wrong method signatures, and version mismatches.

## When to use

- User asks how to use a specific library, SDK, or framework feature
- User is about to implement integration with a third-party service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, Stripe, etc.)
- User asks "does X support Y?", "what's the API for X?", "how to configure X?"
- Before implementing ANY code that calls an external library — even familiar ones
- When context says the project uses a specific version (e.g. `sendgrid@8`, `bullmq@5`)

## Tools required

- `resolve-library-id` — from `context7` MCP server
- `get-library-docs` — from `context7` MCP server

If context7 is unavailable:
- Tell the user: "❌ context7 MCP is not connected. Please check `/mcp`."
- Do NOT fall back to training data for API details — offer to use `b-research` to scrape official docs instead.

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Identify library and topic

Extract from the user's request:
- **Library name**: e.g. `sendgrid`, `bullmq`, `@aws-sdk/client-ses`
- **Topic / feature**: the specific API area needed, e.g. `send email`, `webhook verification`, `retry configuration`, `job scheduling`
- **Version** (if mentioned in conversation or package.json): e.g. `v8`, `v5`

If multiple libraries are involved (e.g. "integrate Mailgun with Express"), run Steps 2–3 for each library separately.

---

### Step 2 — Resolve library ID

Call `resolve-library-id` with the library name.

- If multiple results return, pick the one with the highest match and correct scope (e.g. prefer `@sendgrid/mail` over a community fork)
- If no result found: tell the user "⚠️ context7 has no index for `[library]`. Falling back to b-research to scrape official docs." then invoke b-research workflow

---

### Step 3 — Fetch docs

Call `get-library-docs` with:
- The resolved library ID from Step 2
- `topic`: the specific feature area (keep focused — don't fetch entire docs)
- `tokens`: 8000 for simple APIs, 12000–15000 for complex ones (auth flows, multi-method APIs, SDK setup)

Repeat with a different `topic` if the user's task spans multiple API areas (e.g. "send email" AND "handle bounce webhooks" — fetch both).

---

### Step 4 — Extract and present

From the fetched docs, extract only what's needed for the user's task:

- Correct method names and signatures
- Required vs optional parameters
- Authentication setup (especially if it changed between versions)
- Error codes and exception types
- Any deprecation notices or breaking changes relevant to the user's version

**Do not dump the entire docs.** Summarize the relevant section, show the key API surface, then implement or answer the user's question based on that.

---

### Step 5 — Implement with confidence

Now write the code, knowing the API is accurate for the current version.

- Reference the fetched doc in a brief comment if the API is non-obvious: `// per Context7: sendgrid v8 uses dynamic templates, not legacy templates`
- If the docs reveal a caveat or version difference from what you expected, call it out explicitly before the code

---

## Output format

For a lookup-only request ("how does X work?"):

```
### `[LibraryName]` — [feature/topic]
*(Context7 — [library-id], [version if available])*

[2–3 sentence summary of the API]

**Key methods:**
- `method(params)` — what it does
- ...

**Example:**
\`\`\`js
// minimal working example based on fetched docs
\`\`\`

**Notes:**
- Any gotchas, deprecations, or version differences found in docs
```

For an implementation request ("implement X using Y"):

- Skip the lookup-only format
- Write the implementation directly, informed by the fetched docs
- Add a one-line comment citing Context7 on any non-obvious API call

---

## Topic query tips

Keep the `topic` param focused — a narrow topic returns the right section faster:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `"email"` | `"send email with attachments"` |
| `"authentication"` | `"API key setup"` or `"OAuth flow"` |
| `"errors"` | `"error codes and exception types"` |
| `"setup"` | `"installation and configuration"` |

When the task spans multiple areas, run `get-library-docs` once per topic rather than one broad fetch.

---

## Rules

- Never implement library code from training data alone — always fetch first
- If context7 returns docs for a different major version than the project uses, flag it explicitly: "⚠️ Context7 returned docs for v3 but your package.json shows v8 — API may differ"
- Keep topic queries focused — broad topic = too much noise, wrong section fetched
- If docs are sparse or unhelpful, escalate to `b-research` to scrape official docs directly
- One `get-library-docs` call per distinct API area — don't batch unrelated topics in one fetch
