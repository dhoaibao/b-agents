# b-agent-skills — Skill reference

Detailed reference for all skills in the b-agent-skills suite.
For quick overview and installation, see [README.md](README.md).

## Skill reference

### b-plan

Decomposes any non-trivial task into ordered steps, dependencies, and risks before
any implementation begins. Uses `sequential-thinking` to reason through the happy path,
identify blockers, and surface unknowns. For tasks that modify existing code, scans
the codebase first with `jcodemunch` (`get_repo_outline`, `get_file_outline`) so the
plan references real file paths and respects existing patterns.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-plan: add rate limiting to the API
plan: design the notification system
how should I approach refactoring the auth module?
where do I start with the payment gateway integration?
```

**Output:** Plan file written to `.claude/b-plans/[task-slug].md` in the current
project root — with ordered steps (checkbox format), dependency map, risk flags, and
unknowns marked as `b-docs` or `b-research` calls. b-analyze and b-docs findings are
appended to the same file for use in the execution session.

**Rule:** Never implement in the same session as planning for tasks with 5+ steps.
End session 1 with the plan file, open a new session to execute.

---

### b-docs

Fetches live, version-accurate documentation from Context7 before implementing anything
that involves a library, SDK, or third-party tool. Prevents hallucinated APIs and
version mismatches from stale training data.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-docs: sendgrid send email with attachments
how do I configure retries in bullmq?
what's the API for aws ses v3?
does zod support async validation?
```

**Output:** Accurate method signatures, required parameters, auth setup, error codes,
and deprecation notices for the current version. Routes to implementation, lookup-only,
or returns context to b-feature pipeline depending on how it was called.

**Fallback chain:** context7 → firecrawl direct scrape (if library has a known official docs URL) → b-research (full research pipeline). The firecrawl fallback tries a single `firecrawl_scrape` on the official docs URL before escalating to the heavier b-research pipeline.

---

### b-research

Deep research workflow: search with Brave → scrape full pages with Firecrawl → fetch
versioned docs with Context7 (for library topics) → synthesize into a structured report
with citations. Never relies on search snippets or training data alone.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-research: compare bullmq vs bee-queue for job queues
research: best practices for webhook signature verification
compare Prisma vs Drizzle for a TypeScript project
deep dive into Redis Streams
```

**Output:** Summary, key findings, optional comparison table, and cited sources.
Context7 is used automatically when the topic is a library or framework.

**Limits:** Max 5 URLs scraped per session, fetched in parallel. JS-heavy pages get
one retry with `waitFor: 3000` before being skipped. If Brave returns fewer than 3
relevant results, falls back to `firecrawl_search` which returns full content directly.

---

### b-analyze

Deep code analysis using jcodemunch — maps structure, measures complexity, identifies
duplicate logic, and produces severity-ranked findings with concrete suggestions.
Indexes the codebase first via `index_folder`, then runs `get_repo_outline` →
`get_file_outline` → `get_dependency_graph` → `search_symbols`. For High findings
that match a named anti-pattern, calls `brave_web_search` for a concrete refactoring
suggestion. Uses `sequentialthinking` to produce a sprint-prioritized action list.
Does not fix anything; produces findings only.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-analyze: review the service layer before refactoring
analyze this file for code smells
review the error handling consistency across handlers
```

**Output:** Structure overview (call graph, module map), findings ranked 🔴 High /
🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low, metrics snapshot (complexity, duplication, circular deps),
and recommended next steps.

**Distinction from b-debug:** Use b-analyze when code works but could be better.
Use b-debug when something is broken.

---

### b-debug

Systematic, hypothesis-driven bug tracing. Indexes the codebase first via
`index_folder`, then maps the full execution path with jcodemunch (`get_context_bundle`
→ `find_references` → `get_blast_radius` → `get_symbol`), forms ranked hypotheses
with sequential-thinking, confirms root cause, then fixes. For library-related errors,
searches for known issues via `brave_web_search`, scrapes top 1–2 relevant GitHub
issue/SO pages via `firecrawl_scrape`, and invokes `b-docs` to verify correct API
behavior before verifying hypotheses. Never patches before root cause is confirmed.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-debug: webhook not triggering despite correct URL registration
b-debug: intermittent 500 on /api/send with no error in logs
why is this callback not running?
fix: email queue jobs disappearing silently
```

**Output:** Symptoms summary, execution path map, ranked hypotheses, confirmed root cause,
minimal fix, and verification instructions.

**Rule:** No patch is written until root cause is explicitly confirmed. Library errors
trigger a web lookup and `b-docs` call before hypothesis verification.

---

### b-feature

Full-cycle orchestrator running across two sessions to keep planning context
separate from execution context.

**Session 1 — Planning:**

| Phase | Skill | Conditional? |
|---|---|---|
| Plan | b-plan | Always |
| Understand existing code | b-analyze | Skip if greenfield |
| Fetch library docs | b-docs | Skip if no libraries involved |
| Research unknowns | b-research | Skip if no open decisions |

Ends with plan file written to `.claude/b-plans/[slug].md`. All findings from
b-analyze and b-docs are appended to the file. No implementation in Session 1.

**Session 2 — Execution:**

Triggered by `execute plan from .claude/b-plans/[file].md`. Reads the plan file,
implements step by step (checking off checkboxes), then self-reviews with b-analyze.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-feature: add Amazon SES as a fourth email provider
b-feature: implement exponential backoff retry for all providers
b-feature: add webhook signature verification
```

**Rule:** Always prefix with `b-feature:` to guarantee trigger.

**Not for:** Simple one-file edits (≤4 steps), bug fixes, or quick questions — those
run faster without the full pipeline.

## Usage patterns

### Pattern 1 — New feature
For any non-trivial feature, use the full pipeline:
```
b-feature: [describe the feature]
```
Claude runs Plan → Understand → Docs → Implement → Review automatically.

### Pattern 2 — Debug session
When something is broken:
```
b-debug: [symptom + what was expected]
```
Paste the full error message or stack trace if available.

### Pattern 3 — Before touching unfamiliar code
Before modifying a module you haven't worked with recently:
```
b-analyze: [module or layer name]
```
Then hand off to b-plan to sequence the changes safely.

### Pattern 4 — Choosing a library
Before committing to a new dependency:
```
b-research: compare [option A] vs [option B] for [use case]
```

### Pattern 5 — Integrating a known library
When the library is chosen but the API needs verification:
```
b-docs: [library name] — [specific feature]
```
Always run this before writing integration code, even for familiar libraries.

### Pattern 6 — Manual pipeline
For full control over each step:
```
1. b-plan: [task]          → confirm plan
2. b-analyze: [module]     → understand existing code
3. b-docs: [library]       → fetch accurate API
4. [implement]             → execute plan steps
5. b-analyze: [new code]   → self-review before shipping
```
Same as b-feature but you control the pace at each step.

## Trigger tips

Claude Code may skip skills on tasks that appear simple. To guarantee activation:

- **Prefix with the skill name**: `b-debug: ...`, `b-feature: ...`, `b-plan: ...`
- **Use explicit keywords**: "plan", "analyze", "research", "debug" trigger reliably
- **Describe complexity**: mentioning "multiple files", "new integration", "not sure why" increases trigger rate

When in doubt, call the skill by name.

## Personal / daily skill reference

### b-quick-search

Single-call web lookup via Brave Search. Returns a fast, cited answer from the live
web — no scraping, no deep synthesis. For factual queries (versions, prices, dates,
definitions), also calls `brave_summarizer` in parallel to get an AI-synthesized
answer alongside raw search results.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-quick-search: latest version of Node.js
what's the current price of M4 MacBook Pro?
latest release of Fedora?
recent CVE for OpenSSL?
```

**Output:** Direct answer with source citations. Factual queries use `brave_summarizer`
output as the primary answer; multi-point queries get a short "Key findings" list.

**Distinction from b-research:** If one search can answer it → b-quick-search.
If you need to read multiple full pages → b-research.

**Fallback:** If results are insufficient, says so and suggests b-research.

### b-news

Aggregates today's top tech news from 8 curated sources (Ars Technica, 9to5Google,
9to5Mac, 9to5Linux, BleepingComputer, The Register, How-To Geek, Hacker News),
groups by topic, and outputs a bilingual digest (English + Vietnamese). Uses
`brave_news_search` (not `brave_web_search`) with `freshness: "pd"` for proper
news filtering. All 5 topic searches run in parallel for speed.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-news
tin tức hôm nay
có gì mới hôm nay?
tech news
điểm tin
```

**Output:** Grouped digest with categories — 🤖 AI, 🔒 Security, 📱 Mobile,
💻 Software, 🐧 Linux, 🏢 Big Tech, 📌 Other. Each story has an English headline
+ summary + source link, followed by Vietnamese translation. Max 3 stories per category.

**On-demand detail:** Follow up with "đọc thêm về [story]" to scrape the full article
via firecrawl.
