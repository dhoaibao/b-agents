# b-agents — Agent reference

Detailed reference for all agents in the b-agents suite.
For quick overview and installation, see [README.md](README.md).
Formatting note: bullet style is standardized across all agent specs for consistent readability.

## Agent reference

### b-plan

Decomposes non-trivial tasks into ordered steps, dependencies, and risks before
implementation. Includes a conditional **feasibility gate (Step 0)** for uncertain scope
to confirm Understanding Lock, blockers, and effort. Uses `sequential-thinking` for
decomposition and unknown/risk surfacing. For modify-existing-code tasks, scans with
`jcodemunch` using a shared preflight: cached repo lookup via `resolve_repo` → index health check via `get_repo_outline` (re-index if coverage is implausibly low) → entrypoint discovery via `suggest_queries` → bounded relevant context via `get_ranked_context`, then `get_repo_outline` / `get_file_outline` batch (optional `get_file_tree`) so plans reference real paths/symbols and follow existing patterns.
Includes an explicit **architecture trade-off checkpoint**, an **impact checkpoint** for modify-existing-code tasks (`get_blast_radius` for shared/public symbols; `check_rename_safe` before rename steps), a **deploy safety checkpoint** (new routes/endpoints/UI → suggest feature flag; DB schema changes → document migration ordering — additive before deploy, destructive after; new external service calls/queues → flag availability verification), and a plan-file handoff for execution in a fresh session. Deploy safety findings are appended to the plan's `## Risks` section.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-plan: add rate limiting to the API
plan: design the notification system
how should I approach refactoring the auth module?
where do I start with the payment gateway integration?
```

**Output:** Plan file written to `.opencode/b-plans/[task-slug].md` in the current
project root only (never the user home directory, a parent workspace folder, or another repo) — with ordered steps (checkbox format), dependency map, risk flags, unknowns
marked as `b-docs` or `b-research` calls, and an optional `## Feasibility` section when
Step 0 ran. b-analyze and b-docs findings are appended to the same file for use in
the execution session. Two additional sections are always included for OpenCode execution:
`## Last Gate Failure` (written by b-execute-plan when b-gate fails) and
`## Review Feedback` (written when b-review returns NEEDS FIXES).

**Feasibility gate (Step 0):** Runs when task scope is uncertain or decision is not
yet made. Confirms the Understanding Lock (one-sentence feature description + success
criteria), quick architecture scan for blockers, and effort estimate. Skip if task is
clearly scoped, user has already decided to proceed, or it is ≤3 steps / single-file.

**Step 0/1 de-duplication:** If Step 0 ran, Step 1 skips the scope/end-state questions (already locked in Understanding Lock) and only verifies: (a) greenfield vs existing code, and (b) any hard constraints not yet captured. Avoids asking the same questions twice.

**Issue/ticket field:** Step 1 asks (optional) for an issue/ticket URL or ID. If provided, writes `**Issue**: [value]` to the plan file header after `**Created**`. Accepts full URLs (`https://linear.app/…`, `https://github.com/…/issues/123`), short ticket IDs (`PROJ-456`, `#123`), or free-text references. b-review reads this field to enrich the requirements baseline.

**Rule:** Never execute in the same session as planning — always save to a plan file and open a new session with b-execute-plan.

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit.

**Execution:** After all steps complete, runs **b-gate** (not b-analyze) as the final
quality check. Index refresh: calls `index_file` on each modified file after each step.

**English-only plan files:** Plan files are always written in English — regardless of the user's query language.

---

### b-execute-plan

Orchestrates the full development pipeline (b-analyze → b-tdd → b-gate → b-review → b-commit) by
reading plan files, tracking step completion, and auto-advancing through successful stages. Reads
`.opencode/b-plans/*.md` files, parses checkbox state, displays progress, invokes each agent
automatically, and moves to the next stage on success. Uses `b-tdd` as the default route for
implementation-like steps (including `fix` steps) and pauses only on failure, truly vague routing,
manual steps, NEEDS FIXES verdicts, or parallel step choices.

**Good triggers:**
```
execute plan
run plan: implement-b-execute-plan.md
/b-execute-plan
orchestrate the pipeline
```

**Pipeline structured as 4 explicit phase contracts:**

- **Phase 1 — LoadPlan**: Locates and reads the plan file (from argument or Glob). Builds `{steps[], baseline_completed, has_analysis_context, pending_steps_count, session_counter_threshold}`. Handles session resume (skips `[x]` steps), context window warning (>6 pending steps), session counter + pause trigger, and the **conditional pre-execution analysis (Step 0)**: greenfield plans auto-skip; existing-code plans require Step 0 only when risk triggers are present — ambiguous scope, unfamiliar or multi-file/multi-layer work, shared/public/high-blast-radius modules, or missing/stale `## Context`. Small, local, well-scoped existing-code changes may skip it. Existing `## Context` can satisfy Step 0 only if it is still valid for the current scope; otherwise treat it as missing, refine scope with jcodemunch (`resolve_repo` → `get_ranked_context`), and ask whether to refresh it. Never auto-invokes — asks user first.
- **Phase 2 — SelectNextStep**: Resolves `{step_N, agent_route, is_manual, is_blocked}` from the step state map. Applies the 5-priority routing table (Priority 1 = manual keywords checked first to prevent "create migration" misfires; Priority 5 = b-tdd as last resort and default fallback for implementation work, including `fix` steps). Asks the user only when the step text is too vague to infer any action at all. Checks `## Dependencies` for blocking `[❌]` prerequisite steps. Invocation format is agent-specific: b-tdd → `[plan-file]:[N]`; b-review → `[plan-file]`; b-gate/b-commit → no plan args.
- **Phase 3 — RunStep**: Invokes the selected agent and returns `{outcome: success | failure | needs_fixes | manual_done}`. **b-gate failure shortcut**: if b-gate fails → extract failing check + first ~10 error lines, write to `## Last Gate Failure`, offer auto-launch of `@b-debug` or manual fix. **Manual steps**: instruct user, wait for `done`/`next`/`continue`.
- **Phase 4 — HandleOutcome**: Updates plan file and determines next action. `success/manual_done` → mark `[x]`, re-read file (session counter recompute), advance to Phase 2 or show done summary. When all steps are done, follow-up suggestions must name mapped suite agents explicitly (for example: `@b-review`, `@b-commit`) instead of generic action text. `failure` → mark `[❌]`, `git diff HEAD --stat`, offer rollback, halt. `needs_fixes` (b-review) → write `## Review Feedback`, verify real git changes, ask "cosmetic or new behavior?" → cosmetic: reset b-gate `[x]` → `[ ]`; new behavior: route to b-tdd first, then reset b-gate, then b-review again.

**Output:**
```
📋 Plan: Implement b-execute-plan
Status: 3 of 6 steps complete ✓

✓ Step 1 — Create b-execute-plan agent file
✓ Step 2 — Design agent workflow
✓ Step 3 — Define Tools required
○ Step 4 — Write Output format
○ Step 5 — Update README.md
○ Step 6 — Update REFERENCE.md

→ Invoking Step 4 — Write Output format and Rules sections via @b-tdd (keyword match: 'write')
[@b-tdd invoked automatically with: @b-tdd .opencode/b-plans/implement-b-execute-plan.md:4]
```

**State tracking:** Parses plan file dynamically. If user manually edits the plan,
b-execute-plan re-reads it on the next loop. Checkpoint updates happen automatically
on success; no user signal required for unambiguous agent routes.

**Completion suggestions:** After all plan steps are done, b-execute-plan suggests next actions using explicit suite agent names whenever applicable. Example: `run @b-review to review the diff before commit` and `run @b-commit to draft the commit message and PR description`. Generic suggestions are reserved for actions with no mapped subagent, such as summarizing exact files changed.

**Scope:** Orchestrates Step 0 (b-analyze, conditional) + production pipeline (b-tdd → b-gate → b-review → b-commit). b-plan is out of scope — use b-plan to create plans, b-execute-plan to run them.

**Git safety:** Never autonomously triggers destructive git commands. Rollback (`git checkout -- .`) is offered to the user, never auto-executed. Commits are always delegated to b-commit.

**Distinction from manual pipeline:** b-execute-plan auto-advances through successful
stages, handling agent invocation and state tracking automatically. Users can still run
pipeline agents manually; b-execute-plan eliminates the step-by-step confirmation overhead
while preserving human control on failures, ambiguity, and NEEDS FIXES.

---

### b-docs

Fetches live, version-accurate documentation from Context7 before implementing anything
that involves a library, SDK, or third-party tool. Prevents hallucinated APIs and
version mismatches from stale training data.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-docs: sendgrid send email with attachments
how do I configure retries in bullmq?
what's the API for aws ses v3?
does zod support async validation?
tra cứu cách dùng thư viện Prisma
hướng dẫn sử dụng Zod
```

**Version detection:** When the current project is indexed, b-docs uses jcodemunch (`get_file_tree` + `get_file_content`) to inspect manifests/lockfiles before falling back to native file tools. This keeps manifest discovery aligned with the MCP-first rule.

**Output:** Accurate method signatures, required parameters, auth setup, error codes,
and deprecation notices for the current version. Routes to implementation or lookup-only
depending on how it was called.

**Fallback chain:** context7 → **scope gate** (if no index: classify query as simple or complex; simple lookups with no known docs URL stop immediately rather than auto-escalating) → firecrawl direct scrape (simple lookup + known official docs URL) → b-research (complex queries or insufficient scrape).

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit. The firecrawl fallback tries a single `firecrawl_scrape` on the official docs URL. If the scrape fails or returns <300 words, b-docs notifies the user and actively invokes b-research with the original library and topic query — it does not ask the user to run b-research manually.

---

### b-research

Deep research workflow: classify query type → search with type-specific tool → scrape
full pages with Firecrawl → synthesize into a structured report with citations. Never
relies on search snippets or training data alone. **Token-optimized**: picks 3 highest-quality URLs, strict post-scrape gate, aggressive source filtering.

**Query type routing:**
- `NEWS` queries → `brave_news_search` with `freshness: "pd"/"pw"` (not `brave_web_search`)
- All other queries → `brave_web_search`
- `HOWTO/API` queries → Context7 first, then Brave

**Good triggers:**
```
b-research: compare bullmq vs bee-queue for job queues
research: best practices for webhook signature verification
compare Prisma vs Drizzle for a TypeScript project
deep dive into Redis Streams
```

**Output:** Summary, key findings, optional comparison table, and cited sources.
Context7 is used automatically when the topic is a library or framework.

**Limits:** Max 3 URLs scraped per session (5 for COMPARE queries), selected via strict source hierarchy (Tier 1 official > community > neutral). Pre-scrape filtering eliminates homepages, login pages, aggregators. Post-scrape gate discards <300 words OR topic not mentioned; stops if <2 usable sources remain (no blind rescaping). If Brave returns fewer than 3 relevant results, falls back to `firecrawl_search`. For deep multi-page documentation: use `firecrawl_crawl` + poll `firecrawl_check_crawl_status` (async — do not proceed until `status: "completed"`).

**Context isolation (Step 4):** when ≥ 6 URLs need scraping, spawns a single Explore subagent with the URL list and original research question. The subagent runs all `firecrawl_scrape` calls in parallel, applies the post-scrape quality gate, and returns a compact digest (max 500 words per source with URL). Main context receives only the filtered digest — raw scraped content never floods the main context. When < 6 URLs, scrapes directly in main context. If Agent tool unavailable: falls back to direct parallel scraping in main context.

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit.

---


### b-tdd

Enforces TDD discipline during implementation: detects test stack, enforces the Iron
Law (no production code before a failing test exists), and drives each implementation
step through a full Red-Green-Refactor cycle. No MCP required — uses Bash to run tests.
Stack auto-detected across 7 languages: **Node.js** (`package.json`), **Python** (`pyproject.toml`/`setup.cfg`), **Go** (`_test.go` files), **Rust** (`Cargo.toml` + `#[test]` → `cargo test`), **Java/Kotlin** (`build.gradle`/`pom.xml` → `./gradlew test` or `mvn test`), **Ruby** (`Gemfile` with rspec/minitest → `bundle exec rspec`), **PHP** (`composer.json` with phpunit → `./vendor/bin/phpunit`). Fallback: `Makefile` `test` target, `scripts/test.*`, or any `*Test*`/`*_spec.*` file pattern.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-tdd
test first
viết test trước
red-green-refactor
```

**Argument format:**
- `b-tdd .opencode/b-plans/file.md:3` — single-step mode, runs exactly step 3 (used by b-execute-plan)
- `b-tdd .opencode/b-plans/file.md` — single-step mode, auto-detects first pending step
- `b-tdd` (no args) — iterate-all mode, runs all steps sequentially

**Output:** Per-step RGR checkpoint log (🔴 Red → 🟢 Green → ✅ Refactor). Single-step completion message when called with plan file; full summary + b-gate handoff when iterating all.

**Iron Law:** Never writes production code before a failing test. Documents any
exception with `// b-tdd exception: [reason]`.

**Regression handling:** If a previously passing test breaks during Green, b-tdd determines whether it was caused by the current change (fix production code) or was a pre-existing latent bug (document inline and ask user to decide). Never silently ignores regressions.

**Index refresh:** After each Refactor step, calls `index_file` on all modified files if jcodemunch is available.

**Distinction from b-gate:** b-tdd governs discipline during coding. b-gate validates
the finished result.

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit.

---

### b-gate

Mandatory quality gate — runs after all implementation steps are done. Detects stack
from config files and runs only checks that are present: **lint → typecheck → tests → coverage → security → clean-code → integration/e2e (soft block)**. Hard stops on lint failures, typecheck failures, test failures, coverage threshold violations (when threshold explicitly configured), and high/critical security findings. Soft blocks (warn, continue) on: coverage tool present but no threshold configured, medium/low security, formatting issues, and integration/e2e test failures (integration tests often require external services). Uses Bash only — no MCP required.

**Coverage enforcement (Step 2c.5):** Runs after tests pass. Three-tier behavior: (1) **hard-block** when a threshold is explicitly configured (`coverageThreshold` in jest, `fail_under` in pytest-cov/nyc) and actual coverage falls below it; (2) **soft-warn** when a coverage tool is detected but no threshold is set; (3) **skip** when no coverage tool is detected. Go exception: always soft-warn only (no native threshold enforcement) — reports coverage percentage from `go test -coverprofile` without hard-blocking.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-gate
check quality
kiểm tra chất lượng
validate before done
```

**Stack detection:** checks for `.eslintrc*`, `tsconfig.json`, `pytest.ini`, `package-lock.json`, `.prettierrc*`, `.golangci.yml`, etc. Also detects integration/e2e test configuration: Jest files matching `*integration*`/`*e2e*`, pytest `integration` marker, `Makefile` `test-integration`/`test-e2e` targets, vitest `e2e` project. Skips any check with no config — does not fail because of missing tooling.

**Output:** Gate report listing each check with status (✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED / ⚠️ not configured).
Clear failure message with specific action when any hard stop occurs.

**Rule:** Never passes with unresolved hard failures. On failure, fix the failing check
and re-run that check only before running the full gate again.

**Distinction from b-tdd:** b-gate validates the finished result. b-tdd enforces
discipline before and during coding.

**Distinction from b-analyze:** b-gate runs automated tooling (lint, tests, security).
b-analyze does deep structural analysis — call graphs, complexity, duplication.

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit.

---

### b-review

Pre-PR human-judgment review on changed code. Reads the git diff, establishes requirements
baseline from the plan file (`.opencode/b-plans/`) or `$ARGUMENTS`, then checks five
dimensions: logic correctness (control flow, null handling, async safety, side effects, plus **security review** — auth/authz enforcement, input validation, sensitive data exposure, injection vectors, rate limiting on new public endpoints), requirements coverage (maps each requirement to changed code — ✅/❌/⚠️ Partial), test adequacy (behavior coverage, unhappy paths, regression safety), and an **observability check** on new handlers/endpoints/jobs (entry-point logging present, errors not swallowed, metric emitted if implied). Uses
`sequentialthinking` to consolidate findings and surface what a senior engineer would
flag. Uses `sequential-thinking` as a required consolidation step and does not run automated tooling — that is b-gate's role.

**Impact-aware context selection:** If the repo is locally indexed, b-review uses jcodemunch preflight (`resolve_repo` → `get_repo_outline` health check → `suggest_queries` → `get_ranked_context`) and then `get_changed_symbols` + `get_blast_radius` + `get_impact_preview` to prioritize review depth on high-impact symbols rather than relying only on raw diff size.

**Small-change fast path:** If diff is ≤50 lines AND ≤2 files, accepts any non-empty requirements baseline (one sentence is sufficient), skips the vague-response enforcement loop, and skips both the security review sub-section and the observability check. Full enforcement applies for diffs >50 lines or >2 files.

**Issue enrichment:** After reading the plan file, checks for an `**Issue**:` field. If value starts with `http` → calls `firecrawl_scrape`, trims to 500 words, appends to requirements baseline as `**Issue context** (from [URL]): …`. If scrape returns <200 chars or HTTP 403 → skips silently: "Issue URL requires authentication — using URL as context reference only." If value is a ticket ID (not a URL) → displays as `**Issue reference**: [value]` in review output. If field absent → skips entirely.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-review
b-review: add retry logic to email queue
review before PR
kiểm tra logic trước khi push
what would a reviewer flag?
```

**Output:** Structured checklist — logic findings, requirements coverage table,
edge case / test adequacy notes, reviewer questions, and a READY FOR PR / NEEDS FIXES
verdict with blockers vs suggestions clearly separated.

**Distinction from b-analyze:** b-analyze is pre-implementation structural review
(complexity, duplication, coupling). b-review is post-implementation correctness review
(logic, requirements, tests). Different timing, different questions.

**Distinction from b-gate:** b-gate runs lint/typecheck/tests/security automatically.
b-review checks whether the code does the right thing — automated tools cannot answer that.

**Handoff:** READY FOR PR → run `b-commit`. NEEDS FIXES → fix blockers, re-run b-gate if
code changed, then b-review again.

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit.

---

### b-commit

Reads `git diff HEAD` to understand the change, then outputs a ready-to-use commit
message and PR description — nothing more. Does not stage, commit, push, or create a
PR. Commit message follows conventional commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
(imperative, ≤72 chars, behavior-level). Body explains *why*, not *what*. PR
description uses structured sections: Summary, Why, Changes, Test plan, Notes.
Flags mixed-concern diffs and suggests splitting, but does not refuse to produce output.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-commit
b-commit: add retry logic to email queue
tạo commit
viết commit message
PR description
```

**Output:** Commit message block + PR description block, ready to copy-paste.
On mixed-concern diffs: stops and outputs 2 separate commit message suggestions (one per concern group) with instructions to split via `git add -p`. Does not produce a single unified message for a mixed diff.

**Distinction from b-gate:** b-gate runs automated checks. b-commit produces text only.

**Prerequisite:** b-gate should have passed before running b-commit.

---

### b-analyze

Deep code analysis using jcodemunch — maps structure, measures complexity, identifies
duplicate logic, dead code, and OOP issues; produces severity-ranked findings with
concrete suggestions. Resolves or indexes the codebase first via `resolve_repo` →
`index_folder` (if needed), then runs a shared preflight: `get_repo_health` for repo-level triage, `suggest_queries` for entrypoint discovery and `get_ranked_context` for bounded relevant context, followed by `get_repo_outline` →
`get_file_outline` (batch) → `get_dependency_graph` → `search_symbols`. For symbol
inspection: `get_symbol_source` (single or batch via `symbol_ids[]`). For dead code:
`check_references` + `find_importers`. For OOP: `get_class_hierarchy`. For pattern
similarity: `get_related_symbols`. For complexity confirmation: `get_symbol_complexity`. For hotspot prioritization: `get_hotspots`. For magic numbers/hardcoded strings: `search_text`.
For dbt/SQL projects: `search_columns`. For High findings matching a named anti-pattern,
calls `brave_web_search`. Uses `sequentialthinking` in deep mode to produce a sprint-prioritized
action list. Does not fix anything; produces findings only.

**Stale index detection:** When `resolve_repo` returns an existing index, calls `get_session_stats` and compares `files_indexed` against a Glob count of source files (`**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go,rs,java,rb,php,kt,swift}`). If drift >10%, calls `index_folder` to re-index before proceeding. If `get_session_stats` unavailable: notes "⚠️ Could not verify index freshness" and continues.

**Quick/deep mode:** Pass `quick` as `$ARGUMENTS` to run Steps 1–2 only (structure map — no quality analysis, no sequential-thinking). Allowed calls in quick mode: `resolve_repo`, `suggest_queries`, `get_repo_outline`, `get_file_outline`. Quick mode output is structure overview only (no findings, no severity ratings). Default (no args or `deep`) runs full Steps 1–5.

**Role:** Pre-implementation understanding and standalone code review only. Not called
as a post-implementation self-review — use **b-gate** for that.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-analyze: review the service layer before refactoring
analyze this file for code smells
review the error handling consistency across handlers
```

**Output:** Structure overview (call graph, module map), findings ranked 🔴 High /
🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low, metrics snapshot (complexity, duplication, circular deps),
and recommended next steps.

**Distinction from b-debug:** Use b-analyze when code works but could be better.
Use b-debug when something is broken.

**Distinction from b-gate:** Use b-gate for post-implementation quality validation
(lint, tests, security). Use b-analyze for structural understanding and code review.

**b-debug handoff:** If analysis reveals a bug (broken logic, not just poor style) → state: 'Root cause analysis needed. Run: `b-debug: [symptom] in [entry point]` to trace the execution path.'

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit.

---

### b-observe

Static observability audit — finds missing log statements, silently swallowed errors,
missing metrics instrumentation, and absent tracing context propagation in source code.
Does **not** do runtime profiling or APM configuration — static analysis only.
Uses jcodemunch with a shared preflight: cached repo lookup via `resolve_repo` → entrypoint discovery via `suggest_queries` → bounded relevant context via `get_ranked_context`, then `search_text` for
log/trace/metric patterns, `find_references` on logger/tracer symbols to identify files
with zero instrumentation, `get_symbol_source` to read error handler bodies,
`get_file_outline` (batch) to enumerate all handlers. Uses `sequentialthinking`
to rank findings by on-call impact.

**Stale index detection:** When `resolve_repo` returns an existing index, calls `get_session_stats` and compares `files_indexed` against a Glob count of source files (`**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go,rs,java,rb,php,kt,swift}`). If drift >10%, calls `index_folder` to re-index before auditing. If `get_session_stats` unavailable: notes "⚠️ Could not verify index freshness" and continues.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-observe: the payment service
observability audit
find missing logs in background workers
kiểm tra log trong service xử lý đơn hàng
tìm lỗi bị nuốt trong error handlers
tracing coverage audit
```

**Output:** Grouped findings by gap type — missing logs (🔴/🟡/🟢), missing metrics,
missing tracing spans. Metrics snapshot (handlers audited, % uninstrumented).
Ordered remediation list ranked by "which gap causes the most confusion during an outage".

**Scope:** Static analysis only — no runtime profiling, no APM config, no log format
validation. `console.log` flagged as Medium (observable but unstructured), not High.
If no instrumentation library detected at all → 🔴 High at the top of the report.

**Distinction from b-analyze:** b-analyze covers structural quality (complexity,
coupling, duplication). b-observe covers instrumentation completeness — orthogonal concern.

**Distinction from b-debug:** b-debug traces live failures. b-observe prevents
the silence that makes future failures invisible.

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit.

---

### b-debug

Systematic, hypothesis-driven bug tracing. Resolves or indexes the codebase first via
`resolve_repo` → `index_folder` (if needed), then runs a shared preflight: `get_repo_outline` health check, `suggest_queries`
for entrypoint discovery and `get_ranked_context` for bounded relevant context, then maps the full execution path with jcodemunch
(`get_context_bundle` → `find_references` → `get_blast_radius` → `get_impact_preview` → `get_symbol_source`).
For suspicious functions, uses `get_related_symbols`
to find similar patterns elsewhere. For regression detection: `get_symbol_diff`. For
error string origin: `search_text`. Forms ranked hypotheses with sequential-thinking.
When static analysis is insufficient to confirm root cause, uses a **dynamic verification loop**: add 1–2 targeted log statements at the suspected choke point → instruct user to run the failing scenario and paste output → analyze output to confirm or eliminate hypothesis → remove debug logging after confirmation. Hard cap of 3 iterations; after 3 unconfirmed rounds, surfaces all gathered evidence and escalates (APM/profiler, isolation, or escalation). Confirms root cause, then fixes. For library errors: `brave_web_search` → `firecrawl_scrape`
(with `firecrawl_map` fallback when scrape returns empty) → `b-docs`. Never patches
before root cause is confirmed.

**Stale index detection:** When `resolve_repo` returns an existing index, calls `get_session_stats` and compares `files_indexed` against a Glob count of source files (`**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go,rs,java,rb,php,kt,swift}`). If drift >10%, calls `index_folder` to re-index before proceeding. If `get_session_stats` unavailable: notes "⚠️ Could not verify index freshness" and continues.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-debug: webhook not triggering despite correct URL registration
b-debug: intermittent 500 on /api/send with no error in logs
why is this callback not running?
fix: email queue jobs disappearing silently
```

**Output:** Symptoms summary, execution path map, ranked hypotheses, confirmed root cause,
minimal fix, and verification instructions.

**Rule:** No patch is written until root cause is explicitly confirmed. Library errors
trigger a web lookup and `b-docs` call before hypothesis verification.

**Post-fix index refresh:** After applying a fix, calls `index_file` on each changed file to keep jcodemunch index fresh for subsequent b-analyze calls.

**Post-fix review:** If the fix introduced new code (new function, new module) → optionally run `b-analyze: [fixed module]` to verify no new complexity or duplication was introduced.

**Git safety:** Never triggers destructive git commands. If a commit is needed, delegates to b-commit.

## Usage patterns

### Pattern 1 — New feature
For any non-trivial feature, use the standard pipeline:
```
1. b-plan: [task]          → feasibility gate (Step 0, conditional) + confirm plan
2. b-analyze: [module]     → understand existing code (skip if greenfield)
3. b-docs: [library]       → fetch accurate API (skip if no libraries)
4. b-tdd                   → implement with Iron Law + Red-Green-Refactor per step
5. b-gate                  → lint → typecheck → tests → security → clean-code
6. b-review: [task]        → logic, requirements coverage, edge cases, test adequacy
7. b-commit: [task]        → commit message + PR description text
```
b-plan's execution section automates steps 2 and 5 (b-analyze at start, b-gate at end).

### Pattern 2 — Debug session
When something is broken:
```
b-debug: [symptom + what was expected]
```
Paste the full error message or stack trace if available.

### Pattern 3 — Before touching unfamiliar code
Before modifying a module you haven't worked with recently:
```
b-analyze: [module or layer name]
```
Then hand off to b-plan to sequence the changes safely.

### Pattern 4 — Choosing a library
Before committing to a new dependency:
```
b-research: compare [option A] vs [option B] for [use case]
```

### Pattern 5 — Integrating a known library
When the library is chosen but the API needs verification:
```
b-docs: [library name] — [specific feature]
```
Always run this before writing integration code, even for familiar libraries.

### Pattern 6 — Manual pipeline
For full control over each step:
```
1. b-plan: [task]          → feasibility gate (Step 0, optional) + confirm plan
2. b-analyze: [module]     → understand existing code
3. b-docs: [library]       → fetch accurate API
4. b-tdd                   → implement with Red-Green-Refactor discipline
5. b-gate                  → automated quality validation
6. b-review: [task]        → human-judgment review (logic, requirements, tests)
7. b-commit: [task]        → commit message + PR description text
```
You control the pace at each step. b-plan's execution section automates steps 2 and 5.

## Trigger tips

OpenCode may skip agents on tasks that appear simple. To guarantee activation:

- **Prefix with the agent name**: `b-plan: ...`, `b-tdd`, `b-gate`, `b-debug: ...`, `b-research: ...`
- **Use explicit keywords**: "plan", "tdd", "gate", "analyze", "research", "debug" trigger reliably
- **Describe complexity**: mentioning "multiple files", "new integration", "not sure why" increases trigger rate

When in doubt, call the agent by name.

## Agent interaction map

```
b-plan ──── Step 0 (conditional) ────────► jcodemunch (resolve_repo → get_repo_outline → get_dependency_graph)
       ──── modify existing code ─────────► jcodemunch (resolve_repo → scan structure first)
       ──── flags unknowns ──────────────► b-docs     (library API needed, resolved inline)
                                         ► b-research  (decision needed)
       ──── execution: file modified ────► jcodemunch (index_file to keep index fresh)
       ──── execution: all steps done ──► b-gate     (final quality check)

b-tdd ───── called with [file.md]:[N] ────► single-step mode: run exactly step N, return control
      ───── called with [file.md] only ────► single-step mode: auto-detect first pending step
      ───── called with no args ───────────► iterate-all mode: run all steps sequentially
      [NOTE: b-gate and b-commit do NOT accept [file.md]:[N] — pass no plan args to them]
      ───── detect test stack ─────────────► Bash (read package.json / pyproject.toml / Makefile)
      ───── run tests ─────────────────────► Bash (npm test / pytest / go test ./...)
      ───── refactor complete ─────────────► jcodemunch (index_file on modified files, optional)
      ───── all steps complete ────────────► b-gate (handoff for final validation)
