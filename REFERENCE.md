## Skill reference

### b-plan

Decomposes non-trivial tasks into ordered steps, dependencies, and risks before
implementation. Includes a conditional **feasibility gate (Step 0)** for uncertain scope
to confirm Understanding Lock, blockers, and effort. Uses `sequential-thinking` for
decomposition and unknown/risk surfacing. For modify-existing-code tasks, scans with
`jcodemunch` (`suggest_queries` → `get_repo_outline` → `get_file_outline` batch, optional
`get_file_tree`) so plans reference real paths/symbols and follow existing patterns.
Includes an explicit **architecture trade-off checkpoint** and a plan-file handoff for
execution in a fresh session.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-plan: add rate limiting to the API
plan: design the notification system
how should I approach refactoring the auth module?
where do I start with the payment gateway integration?
```

**Output:** Plan file written to `.claude/b-plans/[task-slug].md` in the current
project root — with ordered steps (checkbox format), dependency map, risk flags, unknowns
marked as `b-docs` or `b-research` calls, and an optional `## Feasibility` section when
Step 0 ran. b-analyze and b-docs findings are appended to the same file for use in
the execution session.

**Feasibility gate (Step 0):** Runs when task scope is uncertain or decision is not
yet made. Confirms the Understanding Lock (one-sentence feature description + success
criteria), quick architecture scan for blockers, and effort estimate. Skip if task is
clearly scoped, user has already decided to proceed, or it is ≤3 steps / single-file.

**Rule:** Never implement in the same session as planning for tasks with 5+ steps.
End session 1 with the plan file, open a new session to execute.

**Execution:** After all steps complete, runs **b-gate** (not b-analyze) as the final
quality check. Index refresh: calls `index_file` on each modified file after each step.

**English-only plan files:** Plan files are always written in English — regardless of the user's query language.

---

### b-execute-plan

Orchestrates the full development pipeline (b-analyze → b-tdd → b-gate → b-review → b-commit) by
reading plan files, tracking step completion, and prompting for each stage. Reads
`.claude/b-plans/*.md` files, parses checkbox state, displays progress, and guides
execution with explicit checkpoints. After each step completes, updates the plan file
and moves to the next stage.

**Good triggers:**
```
execute plan
run plan: implement-b-execute-plan.md
/b-execute-plan
orchestrate the pipeline
```

**Workflow:**
0. **Pre-execution (conditional)**: if the plan modifies existing code and no `## Context` section exists → extract explicit file paths from plan Steps, run b-analyze scoped to only those paths, append as `## Context`. Ask user if scope is ambiguous — never run unconstrained full-repo analysis.
1. Locate plan file: from argument if provided; if none, Glob `.claude/b-plans/*.md` — if multiple exist, list with timestamps and ask (never auto-select). **Session resume**: completed (`[x]`) steps are skipped automatically.
   - **Context window warning**: if pending steps > 6, warn once and suggest splitting at step 5.
2. Parse step checkboxes (`- [ ] Step N` / `- [x]` / `- [❌] Step N — reason`).
3. Display state (✓ / ❌ / ○). Detect skill from keywords — **non-production keywords (delete/remove/config/migrate/document/rename) are checked first** to prevent "create migration" routing to b-tdd. Invocation format is skill-specific: b-tdd → `[plan-file]:[N]`; b-review → `[plan-file]`; b-gate/b-commit → no plan args. Check `## Dependencies` for blocking failures and parallel declarations (offer parallel for b-tdd steps only).
4. Wait for user signal. On failure: capture reason, write `- [❌] N — reason`, run `git diff HEAD --stat` for partial changes, offer `git checkout -- .` rollback before retrying.
5. Update plan checkbox (`[ ]` → `[x]`). Re-read file to recompute session step counter (`current [x] − baseline [x] at session start` — file-based, survives context compression).
6. Loop until done. **NEEDS FIXES re-entry**: user signals fix → run `git diff HEAD --stat` to confirm real changes → ask "cosmetic or new behavior?" → cosmetic: reset b-gate and re-run; new behavior: route through b-tdd first, then b-gate, then b-review. Iron Law is never bypassed.

**Output:**
```
📋 Plan: Implement b-execute-plan
Status: 3 of 6 steps complete ✓

✓ Step 1 — Create b-execute-plan/SKILL.md
✓ Step 2 — Design skill workflow
✓ Step 3 — Define Tools required
○ Step 4 — Write Output format
○ Step 5 — Update README.md
○ Step 6 — Update REFERENCE.md

→ Next: Step 4 — Write Output format and Rules sections
Detected skill: /b-tdd (keyword match: 'write'). Confirm? [y/n]
Run `/b-tdd .claude/b-plans/implement-b-execute-plan.md:4` to proceed, or type a different skill to override.
```

**State tracking:** Parses plan file dynamically. If user manually edits the plan,
b-execute-plan re-reads it on the next loop. Checkpoint updates are explicit and
require user signal (`done`, `next`, or skill invocation).

**Scope:** Orchestrates Step 0 (b-analyze, conditional) + production pipeline (b-tdd → b-gate → b-review → b-commit). b-plan is out of scope — use b-plan to create plans, b-execute-plan to run them.

**Distinction from manual pipeline:** b-execute-plan provides guided checkpoints,
state tracking, and human-in-the-loop orchestration. Users can still run the pipeline
skills manually; b-execute-plan is an optional convenience wrapper.

---

### b-docs

Fetches live, version-accurate documentation from Context7 before implementing anything
that involves a library, SDK, or third-party tool. Prevents hallucinated APIs and
version mismatches from stale training data.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-docs: sendgrid send email with attachments
how do I configure retries in bullmq?
what's the API for aws ses v3?
does zod support async validation?
tra cứu cách dùng thư viện Prisma
hướng dẫn sử dụng Zod
```

**Output:** Accurate method signatures, required parameters, auth setup, error codes,
and deprecation notices for the current version. Routes to implementation or lookup-only
depending on how it was called.

**Fallback chain:** context7 → firecrawl direct scrape (if library has a known official docs URL) → b-research (full research pipeline). The firecrawl fallback tries a single `firecrawl_scrape` on the official docs URL. If the scrape fails or returns <300 words, b-docs notifies the user and actively invokes b-research with the original library and topic query — it does not ask the user to run b-research manually.

---

### b-research

Deep research workflow: classify query type → search with type-specific tool → scrape
full pages with Firecrawl → synthesize into a structured report with citations. Never
relies on search snippets or training data alone.

**Query type routing:**
- `NEWS` queries → `brave_news_search` with `freshness: "pd"/"pw"` (not `brave_web_search`)
- All other queries → `brave_web_search`
- `HOWTO/API` queries → Context7 first, then Brave

**Good triggers:**
```
b-research: compare bullmq vs bee-queue for job queues
research: best practices for webhook signature verification
compare Prisma vs Drizzle for a TypeScript project
deep dive into Redis Streams
```

**Output:** Summary, key findings, optional comparison table, and cited sources.
Context7 is used automatically when the topic is a library or framework.

**Limits:** Max 5 URLs scraped per session (7 for COMPARE), fetched in parallel. JS-heavy pages: retry with `waitFor: 5000/8000`, then `firecrawl_map` to find correct URL before skipping. If Brave returns fewer than 3 relevant results, falls back to `firecrawl_search`. For deep multi-page documentation: use `firecrawl_crawl` + poll `firecrawl_check_crawl_status` (async — do not proceed until `status: "completed"`).

**Context isolation (Step 4):** when ≥ 4 URLs need scraping, spawns a single Explore subagent with the URL list and original research question. The subagent runs all `firecrawl_scrape` calls in parallel, applies the post-scrape quality gate, and returns a compact digest (max 500 words per source with URL). Main context receives only the filtered digest — raw scraped content never floods the main context. When < 4 URLs, scrapes directly in main context. If Agent tool unavailable: falls back to direct parallel scraping in main context.

---


### b-tdd

Enforces TDD discipline during implementation: detects test stack, enforces the Iron
Law (no production code before a failing test exists), and drives each implementation
step through a full Red-Green-Refactor cycle. No MCP required — uses Bash to run tests.
Stack auto-detected from `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go test` conventions.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-tdd
test first
viết test trước
red-green-refactor
```

**Argument format:**
- `b-tdd .claude/b-plans/file.md:3` — single-step mode, runs exactly step 3 (used by b-execute-plan)
- `b-tdd .claude/b-plans/file.md` — single-step mode, auto-detects first pending step
- `b-tdd` (no args) — iterate-all mode, runs all steps sequentially

**Output:** Per-step RGR checkpoint log (🔴 Red → 🟢 Green → ✅ Refactor). Single-step completion message when called with plan file; full summary + b-gate handoff when iterating all.

**Iron Law:** Never writes production code before a failing test. Documents any
exception with `// b-tdd exception: [reason]`.

**Regression handling:** If a previously passing test breaks during Green, b-tdd determines whether it was caused by the current change (fix production code) or was a pre-existing latent bug (document inline and ask user to decide). Never silently ignores regressions.

**Index refresh:** After each Refactor step, calls `index_file` on all modified files if jcodemunch is available.

**Distinction from b-gate:** b-tdd governs discipline during coding. b-gate validates
the finished result.

---

### b-gate

Mandatory quality gate — runs after all implementation steps are done. Detects stack
from config files and runs only checks that are present: **lint → typecheck → tests →
security → clean-code**. Hard stops on lint failures, typecheck failures, test failures,
and high/critical security findings. Soft blocks (warn, continue) on medium/low security
and formatting issues. Uses Bash only — no MCP required.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-gate
check quality
kiểm tra chất lượng
validate before done
```

**Stack detection:** checks for `.eslintrc*`, `tsconfig.json`, `pytest.ini`, `package-lock.json`,
`.prettierrc*`, `.golangci.yml`, etc. Skips any check with no config — does not fail
because of missing tooling.

**Output:** Gate report listing each check with status (✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED / ⚠️ not configured).
Clear failure message with specific action when any hard stop occurs.

**Rule:** Never passes with unresolved hard failures. On failure, fix the failing check
and re-run that check only before running the full gate again.

**Distinction from b-tdd:** b-gate validates the finished result. b-tdd enforces
discipline before and during coding.

**Distinction from b-analyze:** b-gate runs automated tooling (lint, tests, security).
b-analyze does deep structural analysis — call graphs, complexity, duplication.

---

### b-review

Pre-PR human-judgment review on changed code. Reads the git diff, establishes requirements
baseline from the plan file (`.claude/b-plans/`) or `$ARGUMENTS`, then checks three
dimensions: logic correctness (control flow, null handling, async safety, side effects),
requirements coverage (maps each requirement to changed code — ✅/❌/⚠️ Partial), and
test adequacy (behavior coverage, unhappy paths, regression safety). Uses
`sequentialthinking` to consolidate findings and surface what a senior engineer would
flag. Does not run automated tooling — that is b-gate's role.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-review
b-review: add retry logic to email queue
review before PR
kiểm tra logic trước khi push
what would a reviewer flag?
```

**Output:** Structured checklist — logic findings, requirements coverage table,
edge case / test adequacy notes, reviewer questions, and a READY FOR PR / NEEDS FIXES
verdict with blockers vs suggestions clearly separated.

**Distinction from b-analyze:** b-analyze is pre-implementation structural review
(complexity, duplication, coupling). b-review is post-implementation correctness review
(logic, requirements, tests). Different timing, different questions.

**Distinction from b-gate:** b-gate runs lint/typecheck/tests/security automatically.
b-review checks whether the code does the right thing — automated tools cannot answer that.

**Handoff:** READY FOR PR → run `b-commit`. NEEDS FIXES → fix blockers, re-run b-gate if
code changed, then b-review again.

---

### b-commit

Reads `git diff HEAD` to understand the change, then outputs a ready-to-use commit
message and PR description — nothing more. Does not stage, commit, push, or create a
PR. Commit message follows conventional commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
(imperative, ≤72 chars, behavior-level). Body explains *why*, not *what*. PR
description uses structured sections: Summary, Why, Changes, Test plan, Notes.
Flags mixed-concern diffs and suggests splitting, but does not refuse to produce output.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-commit
b-commit: add retry logic to email queue
tạo commit
viết commit message
PR description
```

**Output:** Commit message block + PR description block, ready to copy-paste.
On mixed-concern diffs: stops and outputs 2 separate commit message suggestions (one per concern group) with instructions to split via `git add -p`. Does not produce a single unified message for a mixed diff.

**Distinction from b-gate:** b-gate runs automated checks. b-commit produces text only.

**Prerequisite:** b-gate should have passed before running b-commit.

---

### b-analyze

Deep code analysis using jcodemunch — maps structure, measures complexity, identifies
duplicate logic, dead code, and OOP issues; produces severity-ranked findings with
concrete suggestions. Resolves or indexes the codebase first via `resolve_repo` →
`index_folder` (if needed), then runs `suggest_queries` → `get_repo_outline` →
`get_file_outline` (batch) → `get_dependency_graph` → `search_symbols`. For symbol
inspection: `get_symbol_source` (single or batch via `symbol_ids[]`). For dead code:
`check_references` + `find_importers`. For OOP: `get_class_hierarchy`. For pattern
similarity: `get_related_symbols`. For magic numbers/hardcoded strings: `search_text`.
For dbt/SQL projects: `search_columns`. For High findings matching a named anti-pattern,
calls `brave_web_search`. Uses `sequentialthinking` to produce a sprint-prioritized
action list. Does not fix anything; produces findings only.

**Role:** Pre-implementation understanding and standalone code review only. Not called
as a post-implementation self-review — use **b-gate** for that.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-analyze: review the service layer before refactoring
analyze this file for code smells
review the error handling consistency across handlers
```

**Output:** Structure overview (call graph, module map), findings ranked 🔴 High /
🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low, metrics snapshot (complexity, duplication, circular deps),
and recommended next steps.

**Distinction from b-debug:** Use b-analyze when code works but could be better.
Use b-debug when something is broken.

**Distinction from b-gate:** Use b-gate for post-implementation quality validation
(lint, tests, security). Use b-analyze for structural understanding and code review.

**b-debug handoff:** If analysis reveals a bug (broken logic, not just poor style) → state: 'Root cause analysis needed. Run: `b-debug: [symptom] in [entry point]` to trace the execution path.'

---

### b-debug

Systematic, hypothesis-driven bug tracing. Resolves or indexes the codebase first via
`resolve_repo` → `index_folder` (if needed), then optionally calls `suggest_queries`
(unfamiliar codebases), then maps the full execution path with jcodemunch
(`get_context_bundle` → `find_references` → `get_blast_radius` → `get_symbol_source`).
For suspicious functions, uses `get_related_symbols`
to find similar patterns elsewhere. For regression detection: `get_symbol_diff`. For
error string origin: `search_text`. Forms ranked hypotheses with sequential-thinking,
confirms root cause, then fixes. For library errors: `brave_web_search` → `firecrawl_scrape`
(with `firecrawl_map` fallback when scrape returns empty) → `b-docs`. Never patches
before root cause is confirmed.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-debug: webhook not triggering despite correct URL registration
b-debug: intermittent 500 on /api/send with no error in logs
why is this callback not running?
fix: email queue jobs disappearing silently
```

**Output:** Symptoms summary, execution path map, ranked hypotheses, confirmed root cause,
minimal fix, and verification instructions.

**Rule:** No patch is written until root cause is explicitly confirmed. Library errors
trigger a web lookup and `b-docs` call before hypothesis verification.

**Post-fix index refresh:** After applying a fix, calls `index_file` on each changed file to keep jcodemunch index fresh for subsequent b-analyze calls.

**Post-fix review:** If the fix introduced new code (new function, new module) → optionally run `b-analyze: [fixed module]` to verify no new complexity or duplication was introduced.

---

### b-sync

Syncs Claude skills from the `b-agent-skills` GitHub repo to `~/.claude/skills/` using git + `sync.sh`. No MCP required — only the Bash tool.

**Good triggers:**
```
sync b-skills
update b-skills
install b-skills on new machine
đồng bộ skills
cập nhật skills
cài skills mới
```

**Modes:** BOOTSTRAP (first install: `git clone` + `sync.sh`) vs UPDATE (existing: `git pull` via `sync.sh`). Auto-detected by checking for `~/.b-agent-skills/.git`.

**Output:** Before/after skill list diff — lists added and removed skills, total count. Validates symlinks and frontmatter after sync.

**Distinction from other skills:** b-sync only manages skill installation — it does not invoke other skills.

---

## Usage patterns

### Pattern 1 — New feature
For any non-trivial feature, use the standard pipeline:
```
1. b-plan: [task]          → feasibility gate (Step 0, conditional) + confirm plan
2. b-analyze: [module]     → understand existing code (skip if greenfield)
3. b-docs: [library]       → fetch accurate API (skip if no libraries)
4. b-tdd                   → implement with Iron Law + Red-Green-Refactor per step
5. b-gate                  → lint → typecheck → tests → security → clean-code
6. b-review: [task]        → logic, requirements coverage, edge cases, test adequacy
7. b-commit: [task]        → commit message + PR description text
```
b-plan's execution section automates steps 2 and 5 (b-analyze at start, b-gate at end).

### Pattern 2 — Debug session
When something is broken:
```
b-debug: [symptom + what was expected]
```
Paste the full error message or stack trace if available.

### Pattern 3 — Before touching unfamiliar code
Before modifying a module you haven't worked with recently:
```
b-analyze: [module or layer name]
```
Then hand off to b-plan to sequence the changes safely.

### Pattern 4 — Choosing a library
Before committing to a new dependency:
```
b-research: compare [option A] vs [option B] for [use case]
```

### Pattern 5 — Integrating a known library
When the library is chosen but the API needs verification:
```
b-docs: [library name] — [specific feature]
```
Always run this before writing integration code, even for familiar libraries.

### Pattern 6 — Manual pipeline
For full control over each step:
```
1. b-plan: [task]          → feasibility gate (Step 0, optional) + confirm plan
2. b-analyze: [module]     → understand existing code
3. b-docs: [library]       → fetch accurate API
4. b-tdd                   → implement with Red-Green-Refactor discipline
5. b-gate                  → automated quality validation
6. b-review: [task]        → human-judgment review (logic, requirements, tests)
7. b-commit: [task]        → commit message + PR description text
```
You control the pace at each step. b-plan's execution section automates steps 2 and 5.

## Trigger tips

Claude Code may skip skills on tasks that appear simple. To guarantee activation:

- **Prefix with the skill name**: `b-plan: ...`, `b-tdd`, `b-gate`, `b-debug: ...`, `b-research: ...`
- **Use explicit keywords**: "plan", "tdd", "gate", "analyze", "research", "debug" trigger reliably
- **Describe complexity**: mentioning "multiple files", "new integration", "not sure why" increases trigger rate

When in doubt, call the skill by name.

## Personal / daily skill reference

### b-quick-search

Single-call web lookup via Brave Search. Returns a fast, cited answer from the live
web — no scraping, no deep synthesis. Routes to `brave_news_search` for news/current-events
queries, `brave_web_search` for everything else.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-quick-search: latest version of Node.js
what's the current price of M4 MacBook Pro?
latest release of Fedora?
recent CVE for OpenSSL?
latest news about OpenAI?
```

**Output:** Direct answer with source citations. Multi-point queries get a short "Key findings" list.

**Query routing:** News/current-events → `brave_news_search` (`freshness: "pd"/"pw"`). Versions, prices, docs, CVEs → `brave_web_search`.

**Distinction from b-research:** If one search can answer it → b-quick-search.
If you need to read multiple full pages → b-research.

**Fallback:** If results are insufficient, says so and suggests b-research.

---

### b-news

Aggregates today's top news on any user-specified topic from a domain-matched trusted
source map. Parses user input to extract topics, maps them to authoritative sources
(e.g., finance → reuters/bloomberg/ft, security → bleepingcomputer/krebsonsecurity,
science → nature/sciencedaily), generates 3–5 focused queries, runs them in parallel
via `brave_news_search` with `freshness: "pd"`, then groups results into dynamic
categories derived from the actual topics found. Falls back to `freshness: "pw"` if
fewer than 10 stories are returned. Outputs a bilingual digest (English + Vietnamese)
when the query is in Vietnamese.

**Good triggers:**
```
b-news
b-news AI crypto
b-news tài chính thị trường
b-news khoa học vũ trụ
b-news chính trị thế giới
tin tức hôm nay
có gì mới hôm nay?
điểm tin
```

**No topic specified:** Defaults to tech news (backward compatible with all existing triggers).

**Output:** Grouped digest with dynamically derived categories (emoji + label per sub-topic).
Each story has an English headline + summary + source link, with Vietnamese translation
when the query is in Vietnamese. Header reflects the actual topic(s), not a generic "Tech News" label.
Max 3 stories per category. Footer lists the actual source domains used.

**Source map:** 12 domain tiers — Universal (reuters, apnews, bbc), Tech, AI/ML,
Security, Mobile, Linux, Finance, Crypto, Science, Health, Politics, Startups.
Queries are matched to the relevant tiers; Universal sources are always included as fallback.

**On-demand detail:** Follow up with "đọc thêm về [story]" / "tell me more about [story]"
