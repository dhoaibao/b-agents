  Fast, single-call web lookup via Brave Search — no scraping, no deep synthesis.
  ALWAYS use when the user says "search", "tìm kiếm", "look up", "tìm nhanh",
  "find latest", "tìm mới nhất", "what is the latest version of X", or needs a quick
  current-info lookup: latest releases, prices, changelogs, CVEs.
  Use b-research instead when the user wants depth, comparison, or a full report.

# b-quick-search

Single-call web lookup via Brave Search. Fast, cited, no scraping.
The rule is simple: one search call, one clean answer.

## When to use

- User says: "search", "tìm", "look up", "find", "tìm nhanh", "latest X", "current X"
- Queries about: latest versions, recent news, current prices, new releases, CVEs
- Any question where training data might be stale and one search is enough
- User explicitly says `b-quick-search` or "use brave search"

## When NOT to use

- User wants a deep dive, comparison, or multi-source report → use **b-research**
- Topic is a library/framework and the user wants API details → use **b-docs**
- The answer clearly requires reading full articles, not just search snippets

## Tools required

- `brave_web_search` — from `brave-search` MCP server (required)
- `brave_summarizer` — from `brave-search` MCP server *(optional, for factual queries)*

If unavailable: stop and tell the user:
"❌ brave-search MCP is not connected. Please check `/mcp`."
Do NOT substitute with any other search tool or training data.

Graceful degradation: ❌ Not possible — this skill requires live web data. If the MCP is unavailable, stop and tell the user.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Search

Call `brave_web_search` with:
- A focused, specific query (1–6 words works best)
- `count: 5` — enough for a quick lookup, not overwhelming
- English queries unless the topic is Vietnamese-specific

If the first query returns no useful results, retry once with a rephrased query.
Rephrasing tips: add the current year, replace ambiguous words with specific technical terms (e.g. "fix" → "patch", "tool" → the exact product name), add the full product/company name, or remove generic qualifiers like "best" or "how to".
If the retry also fails → tell the user the search returned no relevant results
and suggest they try b-research for a deeper lookup.

**For factual queries** (version numbers, prices, dates, definitions, yes/no questions):
Also call `brave_summarizer` with the same query in parallel with `brave_web_search`.
Use the summarizer output as the primary answer; use search result URLs as citations.

### Step 2 — Synthesize

Do NOT dump raw results. Write a clean, direct response:
- Lead with the direct answer (from summarizer if available, otherwise from search snippets)
- Include version numbers and dates when relevant
- Group related findings if results cover multiple aspects
- Cite sources at the end

## Output format

```
[Direct answer]

Key findings:
- Finding 1 (source title if needed)
- Finding 2

Sources:
- [Title](URL)
- [Title](URL)
```

For single-fact lookups (e.g. "latest version of X"), skip "Key findings" and
just answer directly with one source citation inline.

## Rules

- Maximum 2 search calls — one primary, one retry if needed. This is still a quick lookup, not a full research session.
- Never use training data as the answer — always search first
- Never substitute another tool if brave-search is unavailable
- Keep answers concise — no need to reproduce full article content
- If results are insufficient for a confident answer, say so and suggest b-research
