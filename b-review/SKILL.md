  Pre-PR code review — verify logic correctness, requirements fulfillment, edge case
  coverage, and test adequacy before opening a pull request. ALWAYS use when the user
  says "review before PR", "kiểm tra logic", "check requirements", "what would a reviewer
  flag", or after b-gate passes and before committing. Distinct from b-analyze (structural
  quality, pre-implementation) and b-gate (automated tooling): b-review simulates
  human-judgment review on changed code.

# b-review

$ARGUMENTS

Review changed code from a reviewer's perspective before it becomes a PR. Checks logic
correctness, requirements coverage, edge cases, and test adequacy — the things automated
tooling cannot catch.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as a pointer to the plan file or a description of
the original requirements (e.g. `add retry logic to email queue`). Use it as the
requirements baseline for Step 2.

## When to use

- After b-gate passes, before committing or opening a PR.
- User says "review before PR", "kiểm tra logic trước khi push", "what would a reviewer flag".
- Validating that the implementation actually fulfills the original requirements.
- Checking if test coverage is adequate for the behavior that was changed.

## When NOT to use

- Structural quality review (complexity, duplication, coupling) → use **b-analyze**
- Automated checks (lint, typecheck, tests, security) → use **b-gate**
- Something is broken → use **b-debug**
- Pre-implementation understanding → use **b-analyze**

## Tools required

- `Bash` — to read git diff and changed file list.
- `sequentialthinking` — from `sequential-thinking` MCP server — structured review reasoning.
- `get_symbol_source`, `get_context_bundle` — from `jcodemunch` MCP server *(optional, for reading full context of changed symbols)*

If sequential-thinking is unavailable: reason through review dimensions inline, document each explicitly.
If jcodemunch is unavailable: use Read tool to inspect changed files directly.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — core review works with Bash + Read. sequential-thinking improves structure of findings; jcodemunch improves symbol context. All optional.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Get the diff

Run:
```bash
git diff HEAD
```

If the output is empty: try `git diff --staged` (staged but not committed). If still empty: try `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` (last commit). If still empty: ask the user — "No uncommitted, staged, or recent changes found. Which changes should I review? (Provide a commit hash, branch name, or describe the change.)" Do not proceed with an empty diff.

Extract:
- **Files changed**: list of modified, added, deleted files.
- **Changed lines**: what was added (+) and removed (-)
- **Scope**: how wide is the change? (1 file vs 10 files is a different review depth)

If the diff is large (>500 lines changed), ask the user which area to focus on first rather than reviewing everything at once.

---

### Step 2 — Establish requirements baseline

Determine what the code was *supposed* to do:

1. **Check for plan file** — look for `.claude/b-plans/[task-slug].md`. If found, read the `## Steps` section and the original scope statement. This is the primary requirements source.
2. **Check $ARGUMENTS** — if provided:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` ends in `.md` → use `Read` to verify the file exists. If it exists, treat it as the primary requirements source (same as a plan file found in `.claude/b-plans/`).
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` does not end in `.md` → treat it as a text description of requirements.
3. **Ask the user** — if neither is available, ask: "What was this change supposed to accomplish? What does 'done' look like?" Initial ask, then one re-prompt if vague — two questions maximum.

**Vague response enforcement**: if the user's answer is fewer than 2 sentences or lacks specific behavior or acceptance criteria, ask once more with a concrete example prompt:
> "Please be more specific. For example: 'The retry logic should attempt 3 times with exponential backoff, and log each failure. It should not retry on 4xx errors.' What specific behavior should this code exhibit, and how would you verify it works?"

If the response is still vague after the second prompt, pause with:
> "Cannot review without a clear requirements baseline. Please answer: What specific behavior should the changed code exhibit, and how would you verify it works?"
Do not proceed to Step 3 until a concrete answer is provided.

The review is only as good as the requirements baseline. Do not review without it.

### Step 3 — Logic correctness review

Read the changed code (use `get_symbol_source` or Read tool) and check:

**Control flow**
- Are all branches of conditionals handled? (if/else, switch cases, error paths)
- Are there unreachable branches or always-true conditions?
- Are loops bounded? Can they run forever?

**Data handling**
- Are null/undefined/empty inputs handled?
- Are type coercions or implicit conversions safe?
- Are array/object accesses guarded against out-of-bounds or missing keys?

**Async correctness** *(if applicable)*
- Are all async paths awaited?
- Are errors from async operations caught?
- Are there race conditions between parallel operations?

**Side effects**
- Does the code modify shared state unexpectedly?
- Are there unintended writes to external systems (DB, cache, queue) in non-obvious paths?

For each issue found: state the file, line range, what the problem is, and what the correct behavior should be.

---

### Step 4 — Requirements coverage check

Map each requirement from Step 2 against the changed code:

| Requirement | Covered? | Where |
|---|---|---|
| [Requirement 1] | ✅ / ❌ / ⚠️ Partial | [file:line or "not found"] |

**✅ Covered**: code explicitly implements this behavior
**❌ Missing**: no code implements this requirement
**⚠️ Partial**: partially implemented — describe what's missing

Flag any requirement that is ❌ or ⚠️ as a blocker before PR.

---

### Step 5 — Edge case and test adequacy check

**Edge cases to check** (based on the type of change):
- Empty input, zero values, negative numbers.
- Maximum/minimum boundary values.
- Concurrent or repeated invocations.
- Failure of downstream dependencies (DB down, API timeout)
- Unexpected input types.

**Test adequacy check**:
- Does a test exist for each requirement from Step 2?
- Do tests cover the unhappy path (errors, empty results, invalid input)?
- Are tests testing behavior or implementation details? (behavior tests survive refactors; implementation tests don't)
- Is there a test that would catch a regression if this code was accidentally reverted?

If tests are missing for a requirement or critical edge case: flag as a finding, not just a suggestion.

---

### Step 6 — Use sequential-thinking to consolidate

Call `sequentialthinking` with:
> "Given these review findings [list from Steps 3–5], which issues must be fixed before this PR can be merged, which are suggestions, and what specific question would a senior engineer ask about this code?"

Use the output to produce the final report.

## Output format

```
### b-review: [task / PR title]

**Diff scope**: [N files changed, +X -Y lines]
**Requirements baseline**: [plan file / $ARGUMENTS / user-stated]

---

#### Logic correctness
✅ No issues found
— or —
❌ [Issue]: [file:line] — [what's wrong] → [what it should do]

---

#### Requirements coverage
| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [req] | ✅ / ❌ / ⚠️ | [detail] |

---

#### Edge cases & test adequacy
✅ Covered
— or —
⚠️ Missing test: [behavior] — [why it matters]
❌ Missing test: [critical behavior] — [risk if untested]

---

#### Reviewer questions
> [Question a senior engineer would ask about this code]

---

#### Verdict
**[READY FOR PR / NEEDS FIXES]**

Blockers (must fix before PR):
- [item]

Suggestions (non-blocking):
- [item]
```

---

## Rules

- Never review without a requirements baseline — a review without knowing what was intended produces noise, not signal.
- Blocker = anything that would cause a reviewer to request changes before merge.
- Suggestion = improvement that does not block correctness or requirement fulfillment.
- Do not re-run automated checks (lint, tests) — b-gate owns that; b-review owns human judgment.
- If logic is too complex to understand without running it, say so — do not guess.
- Keep the diff scope in mind: a 3-line fix needs a lighter review than a 200-line feature.
- If requirements are not fulfillable with the current implementation, state clearly: "Requirement X is not met — the implementation does Y instead of Z".
