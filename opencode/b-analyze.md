# b-analyze

$ARGUMENTS

Understand code before changing it. Use jcodemunch to map structure, measure quality,
and surface concrete improvements — not vague suggestions.

**`$ARGUMENTS` mode detection** — parse `$ARGUMENTS` before starting:
- **`quick`**: run Step 1 and a limited Step 2 (structure map only — no quality analysis, no sequential-thinking). Allowed jcodemunch calls: `resolve_repo`, `suggest_queries`, `get_repo_outline`, `get_file_outline`. Skip: `get_dependency_graph`, `search_symbols`, `check_references`, `find_importers`. Output: structure overview only — no findings, no severity ratings.
- **`deep`** or **absent**: run full Steps 1–5 (default behavior).

## When to use

- Before a refactor: understand what exists before changing it.
- Code review: assess quality, consistency, and maintainability.
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase or module.
- Identifying duplicate logic, high-complexity hotspots, or inconsistent patterns.
- User says: "analyze", "review", "phân tích code", "refactor", "tìm code smell".

**Difference from b-debug**: b-analyze is for code that works but could be better.
b-debug is for code that is broken. If there's an error message → use b-debug instead.

## When NOT to use

- Something is broken and needs debugging → use **b-debug**
- Planning a new task or sequencing work → use **b-plan**
- Quick fact lookup → call `brave_web_search` or `brave_news_search` directly; library API question → use **b-docs**
- Post-implementation quality validation (lint, tests, security) → use **b-gate**

## Tools required

From `jcodemunch` MCP server:
- `resolve_repo` — cached repo map lookup; reuse an existing repo identifier before indexing.
- `index_folder` — index a local codebase before querying.
- `suggest_queries` — auto-surface entry points, language distribution, and key architectural symbols.
- `get_ranked_context` — pack the most relevant symbols/files into a bounded context window before deep analysis.
- `get_repo_health` — one-call repo triage snapshot (dead code %, dependency cycles, hotspot summary) to prioritize where to look first.
- `get_repo_outline` — overview of all modules, files, and top-level symbols.
- `get_file_outline` — functions, classes, and exports per file (supports batch: `file_paths=[]`)
- `get_symbol_source` — get full source of one symbol (`symbol_id`) or many (`symbol_ids[]`); supports verify and context_lines.
- `get_dependency_graph` — module coupling and circular dependency detection.
- `search_symbols` — find duplicate or similarly-named functions across files.
- `find_importers` — find all files that import a given module (dead code chain detection)
- `check_references` — verify if a symbol has any live references (dead code detection)
- `get_class_hierarchy` — map class inheritance trees for OOP codebases.
- `get_related_symbols` — discover functions closely associated with a symbol (pattern similarity)
- `get_symbol_complexity` — verify actual cyclomatic complexity on suspicious functions instead of estimating by eye.
- `get_hotspots` — identify complex + high-churn code that deserves priority in the findings.
- `search_text` — search for literal strings or regex patterns (magic numbers, hardcoded values)
- `search_columns` — from jcodemunch MCP server *(optional, for dbt/SQL/data warehouse projects)*

From `sequential-thinking` MCP server:
- `sequentialthinking` — required in deep mode for structured prioritization of findings and ordered action list.

From `brave-search` MCP server *(optional)*:
- `brave_web_search` — look up refactoring solutions for named anti-patterns found during analysis.

**jcodemunch is required for this agent.** Never use Glob/Grep/Read to explore structure when jcodemunch is available — they produce an incomplete picture for analysis tasks.

If jcodemunch is unavailable: use `Glob` to map file structure, `Grep` for symbol/pattern search, `Read` for file inspection. Note in report: "⚠️ jcodemunch unavailable — analysis based on Glob/Grep/Read; cross-file dependency tracking, dead code detection, and call graph analysis are unavailable."

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — analysis degrades significantly without jcodemunch (no call graph, no cross-file references, no dead code). Flag all limitations explicitly in the report.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Define analysis scope

Clarify what to analyze and why:

- **Target**: specific file, directory, module, or layer (e.g. "the service layer", "all route handlers")
- **Goal**: what decision will this analysis inform? (refactor, code review, onboarding, pre-feature audit)
- **Depth**: quick overview vs deep structural analysis.

If the user says "analyze the whole project" without further context, ask which layer or
concern matters most — analyzing everything produces noise.
Exception: if the project has fewer than 15 files, proceed with whole-project analysis without asking — the noise risk is low.

---

### Step 2 — Structural analysis

Use `jcodemunch` to map the target code in this order:

1. **jcodemunch preflight** — run the standard preflight (see `global/AGENTS.md § jcodemunch preflight`) with query = "code structure and quality of [target + goal from Step 1]". Use the returned repo identifier and ranked context for all subsequent calls.
2. `get_repo_health` — capture repo-level risk signals first (hotspots, dead code %, cycle count) so deep analysis starts with the highest-leverage area.
3. `get_repo_outline` — overview of all modules, files, and top-level symbols
4. `get_file_outline` (batch: pass `file_paths=[...]` from the ranked context) — inspect each file for functions, classes, and exports; use batch mode to load multiple files in one call
5. `get_dependency_graph` — map module coupling; look for circular deps and tight coupling
6. `search_symbols` — find duplicate or similarly-named functions across files

From these, extract:
- **Call graph**: what calls what, entry points, leaf functions.
- **Dependency map**: which modules depend on which, circular dependencies.
- **File/module boundaries**: what's responsible for what.
- **Size distribution**: unusually large files or functions are complexity hotspots.

Goal: build a mental model of the code's shape before evaluating its quality.

---

### Step 3 — Quality analysis

With the structure mapped, evaluate:

**Complexity**
- Functions or methods with high cyclomatic complexity (use `get_symbol_complexity`; flag anything >10)
- Deeply nested conditionals or loops.
- Long functions that do more than one thing.

**Duplication**
- Similar logic appearing in multiple places.
- Copy-pasted error handling, validation, or transformation code.
- Inconsistent patterns for the same concern (e.g. 3 different ways to handle errors)

**Cohesion & coupling**
- Modules that know too much about each other.
- Single files/classes doing too many unrelated things.
- Cross-layer violations (e.g. DB queries inside route handlers)

**Maintainability signals**
- Missing or misleading names (variables, functions, files)
- Magic numbers or hardcoded values: use `search_text(is_regex=true, pattern='[0-9]{4,}')` to find suspicious numeric constants; use `search_text` with specific string patterns to find hardcoded configuration values.
- Dead code: use `check_references` on any function that appears to have no callers — a zero-reference count confirms dead code. Use `find_importers` to trace the full import chain before removing a module (verifies it truly has no dependents)

**Class hierarchy (OOP codebases)**
- Use `get_class_hierarchy` on base classes to map inheritance chains — hierarchies deeper than 3 levels are a coupling signal.

**Pattern similarity**
- Use `get_related_symbols` on key functions to discover semantically similar functions across the codebase — candidates for consolidation or inconsistent implementations of the same concern.

**Hotspot prioritization**
- Use `get_hotspots` when the scope is a full repo or large module — if a symbol is both high-complexity and high-churn, prioritize it above static style findings.

**Data modeling** *(dbt/SQL projects only)*
- Use `search_columns` to audit column naming consistency, find undocumented columns, and verify column descriptions match actual usage.

For any **🔴 High** finding that involves a named anti-pattern (e.g., circular dependency, god class, N+1 query, DB query in controller) → call `brave_web_search` with `'{pattern name} refactoring solution'`. Use the result to make the concrete suggestion in Step 4 specific: exact technique name + example structure, not just "extract this into a service". Do NOT call brave_web_search for 🟡 Medium or 🟢 Low findings — only High findings warrant the extra lookup cost.

---

### Step 4 — Produce findings

Organize findings by severity:

- **🔴 High**: causes maintenance burden now, or will cause bugs soon (circular deps, very high complexity, cross-layer violations)
- **🟡 Medium**: technical debt that slows down development (duplication, inconsistent patterns, large functions)
- **🟢 Low**: nice-to-have improvements (naming, minor reorganization)

For each finding:
- State exactly what was found and where (file, function, line range if relevant)
- Explain why it's a problem — not just "this is bad".
- Suggest a concrete improvement — not just "refactor this".

After grouping findings by severity, call `sequentialthinking` with the question: "Given these findings, if the team can address only 3 issues this sprint, which 3 have the highest ROI and in what order?" Use the result to produce an **Ordered action list** at the top of the Recommended Next Steps section.

---

### Step 5 — Recommend next actions

Based on findings, suggest:

- If refactor is needed → hand off to `b-plan` to sequence the refactor safely.
- If a specific pattern is broken → flag which functions need fixing and in what order.
- If complexity is concentrated in one area → suggest splitting it first before any other changes.
- If findings are minor → list them as a backlog, not urgent action.

## Output format

```
### Analysis: [target — file, module, or layer]

**Scope**: [what was analyzed]
**Goal**: [what decision this informs]

---

**Structure overview**
[Call graph or module map — brief, not exhaustive]
[Key entry points, main dependencies]

---

**Findings**

🔴 High priority
- [Finding]: [where] — [why it's a problem] → [concrete suggestion]

🟡 Medium priority
- [Finding]: [where] — [why it's a problem] → [concrete suggestion]

🟢 Low priority
- [Finding]: [where] — [suggestion]

---

**Metrics snapshot**
- Highest complexity: `[function]` — cyclomatic complexity [N]
- Largest file: `[file]` — [N] lines
- Duplication detected: [yes/no — where]
- Circular dependencies: [yes/no — which]

---

**Recommended next steps**
1. [Most impactful action first]
2. ...

*Use `b-plan` to sequence the refactor if proceeding.*
```

---

## Rules

- Never suggest a refactor without first understanding the full structure — partial analysis leads to wrong recommendations.
- Findings must be specific: file + function + reason, not "this module is messy".
- Every High finding must have a concrete suggestion, not just a complaint.
- Don't fix anything during analysis — this agent produces findings, not changes.
- If analysis reveals a bug (broken logic, not just poor style) → state: 'Root cause analysis needed. Run: `b-debug: [symptom] in [entry point]` to trace the execution path.'
- Keep Low findings in the report but don't let them dominate — focus on what actually matters.
- After outputting findings, always recommend whether to proceed with `b-plan` or if the code is healthy enough to modify directly.
- Never trigger destructive git commands — no `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, `git checkout -- <file>`, or `git branch -D`. If a commit is needed after completing work, delegate to b-commit.
