# b-plan

Think before coding. Use sequential-thinking to decompose tasks into ordered steps,
surface dependencies, identify risks, and produce a clear execution plan — before any
implementation begins.

## When to use

- Task involves more than 2 files or multiple layers (API, DB, service, UI).
- Task has unclear scope or multiple valid approaches.
- User is about to implement something non-trivial and hasn't thought through the order.
- Refactoring, architecture changes, or new feature integration.
- User says: "plan", "thiết kế", "how should I approach X", "lên kế hoạch", "nên bắt đầu từ đâu".

## When NOT to use

- Simple single-file edit or ≤2-step task → do it directly.
- Something is broken and needs debugging → use **b-debug**.
- Quick fact lookup → call `brave_web_search` or `brave_news_search` directly; library API question → use **b-docs**.

## Tools required

- `sequentialthinking` — from `sequential-thinking` MCP server (required for Step 2 decomposition and trade-off decisions).
- `resolve_repo`, `suggest_queries`, `get_ranked_context`, `get_repo_outline`, `get_file_outline`, `get_file_tree`, `get_blast_radius`, `check_rename_safe`, `index_file` — from `jcodemunch` MCP server *(required for modify-existing-code tasks; optional for pure greenfield work)*.
- `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs` — from `context7` MCP server *(optional, for inline library verification in Step 3 — simple lookups only; delegate complex research to b-docs)*.
- `brave_web_search` — from `brave-search` MCP server *(optional, for tool/approach comparison in Step 3 — simple lookups only; delegate multi-source research to b-research)*.

If sequential-thinking is unavailable: reason through the plan inline step by step,
making the thinking explicit in the response. Do not skip planning — just do it without the tool.
If jcodemunch is unavailable, or `index_folder` returns `file_count = 0`: use Glob/Read to inspect key files manually before Step 2 and explicitly note that blast-radius / rename-safety checks were skipped.
If context7 is unavailable: delegate library verification to b-docs as before.
If brave-search is unavailable: delegate tool comparison to b-research as before.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — if jcodemunch unavailable, use Glob/Read. If sequential-thinking unavailable, reason inline. context7 and brave-search are convenience shortcuts; b-docs and b-research are always available as fallbacks.

## Steps

### Step 0 — Feasibility gate *(conditional)*

Run if the task introduces significant behavior, touches unfamiliar code, or the user has not decided to proceed.
Skip if the task is clearly scoped, already approved, or ≤3 steps/single-file.

**Understanding Lock** — before scanning code, confirm:
- **What does the user want?** State the feature in one sentence. Ask the user to confirm.
- **What does "done" look like?** List 2–4 concrete success criteria.
- **Any hard constraints?** (Performance, compatibility, tech stack limits, deadline.)
- **Is the decision already made?** If yes, skip this step entirely — move to Step 1.

If the user corrects scope, update and re-confirm once. If still unclear, ask one focused clarifying question.

**Quick feasibility scan** — once scope is locked, check:
1. Does the current architecture support this? Use jcodemunch (`get_repo_outline`, `get_dependency_graph`) or Glob/Read if jcodemunch is unavailable.
2. Are there blockers? (Missing infrastructure, incompatible dependencies, fundamental architectural gaps.)
3. Effort estimate: S (hours) / M (1–2 days) / L (3–5 days) / XL (1–2 weeks) / XXL (weeks+).

**Scope of Step 0:** lightweight gate only (architecture fit, blockers, effort). It does not replace deep docs/research work (`b-docs`, `b-research`) for uncertain external constraints.

**Gate outcome:**
- No blockers, effort S–L → proceed to Step 1.
- No blockers, effort XL–XXL AND any of the following apply → **stop and run a dedicated research session before planning**: unfamiliar architectural pattern (event sourcing, CQRS, real-time sync), unverified library capability, large blast radius, third-party service constraints unknown. Use `b-docs` or `b-research` to resolve these, then return to b-plan.
- No blockers, effort XL–XXL, constraints known → surface scope to user, confirm, then proceed to Step 1.
- Blocker found → follow this escalation sequence:
  1. **State the blocker clearly**: describe exactly what is blocked and why.
  2. **If a workaround exists** → document it explicitly and ask the user to confirm before proceeding to Step 1. Label any plan step that depends on the workaround with a `⚠️ depends on workaround for [blocker]` note.
  3. **If no workaround exists** → recommend descoping (remove or defer the blocked scope) or resolving the blocker first. **Do NOT proceed to Step 1** until the blocker is resolved or descoped.
  4. **Never plan around an unresolved blocker.** Planning around an unknown is a risk you can surface; planning around a known blocker produces a plan that will fail at execution time.

Append a `## Feasibility` section to the plan file (optional — only if Step 0 was run):
```markdown
## Feasibility
**Effort**: [S/M/L/XL/XXL]
**Blockers**: [none / description]
**Assumptions confirmed**: [list]
```

---

### Step 1 — Clarify scope

**If Step 0 was run**: skip scope and end-state confirmation — already locked in Understanding Lock. Only verify:
- (a) **Greenfield vs existing code?** Is this a new module or modifying existing files?
- (b) **Any hard constraints not yet captured?** (Only ask if Step 0 did not already surface them.)

**If Step 0 was skipped**: confirm all three:
- **What is the end state?** What does "done" look like exactly?
- **What already exists?** Is this greenfield or modifying existing code?
- **What are the constraints?** Deadlines, must-not-break areas, tech stack limits?

**In both cases**, ask once (optional):
- **Issue/ticket URL or ID?** (optional — leave blank to skip) If provided, store as `**Issue**: [value]` in the plan file header, after `**Created**`. Accepts any format: full URL (`https://linear.app/…`, `https://github.com/…/issues/123`), short ticket ID (`PROJ-456`, `#123`), or free-text reference.

If ambiguous, ask one focused clarifying question. Once clear, proceed.

---

### Step 1.5 — Scan existing code *(conditional)*

Run if: task modifies or extends existing code.
Skip if: pure greenfield with no existing modules.

Use jcodemunch to scan before decomposition:
- Run the standard preflight (see `global/AGENTS.md § jcodemunch preflight`) with query = "[requested change description — feature, module, or bugfix area]". Use the returned ranked context as the primary read set for planning.
- `get_file_tree(path_prefix="src/")` — scoped directory view when the task targets a subdirectory.
- `get_repo_outline` — understand overall structure, file layout, module boundaries.
- `get_file_outline` (batch: `file_paths=[...]`) — inspect specific files the plan will touch; use batch mode to load multiple files in one call.

**Goal**: reference real paths/symbols and follow existing patterns. Wrong assumptions here cause execution failure later.

---

### Step 2 — Decompose with sequential-thinking

Use `sequential-thinking` to create atomic steps:

- Independently executable and verifiable.
- Ordered by dependency.
- Usually 4–8 steps (split into phases if >10).
- Each step answers: *what*, *why now*, *done when*.
- Explicitly capture happy path, dependencies, and key risks/fallbacks.

**Architecture trade-off checkpoint** — if the task involves a structural decision (e.g., new module vs extending existing, sync vs async, REST vs event-driven), surface it explicitly:
- State the 2–3 viable approaches and the key trade-offs (complexity, performance, coupling).
- Pick one and document the reason.
- Do not leave architecture decisions implicit inside a step description.

**Impact checkpoint for modify-existing-code tasks** — before finalizing the step order:
- Use `get_blast_radius` on the main symbol/module being changed when the plan alters an existing public function, service boundary, or shared module.
- Use `check_rename_safe` before proposing any rename step for an exported/public symbol.
- If either call reveals wide downstream impact, split the plan into smaller phases or add explicit rollback / verification steps.

**Deploy safety checkpoint** — after decomposing steps, scan the plan for the following patterns and annotate accordingly:

(a) **Feature flags** — steps that add new routes, endpoints, or user-facing UI:
  - Mark as: `⚠️ consider feature flag: new behavior reachable in production without explicit enable`
  - Only flag steps with new user-visible behavior — not internal refactors.

(b) **Migration ordering** — steps that include DB schema changes (new table, column, index, constraint modification):
  - **Additive migrations** (add column, add table): run **before** app deploy — document as a step dependency note.
  - **Destructive migrations** (drop column, alter type): run **after** old code is fully removed — document as a step dependency note.
  - Label the migration step with: `⚠️ deploy order: [run before / run after] app deploy`

(c) **External dependencies** — steps that add new external service calls, queues, or third-party APIs:
  - Mark as: `⚠️ verify availability in target environment before deploy`

Document any flags found under the plan's `## Risks` section. If no patterns match, skip this checkpoint silently — do not add empty sections.

---

### Step 3 — Identify unknowns

Flag anything that must be resolved before or during execution:

- **Docs needed**: library/API behavior that needs verification → mark as `b-docs` call.
- **Research needed**: tool or approach comparison → mark as `b-research` call.
- **Decisions needed**: choices that depend on user preference or business logic.
- **Assumptions**: things the plan assumes to be true — state them explicitly.

If a "Docs needed" unknown affects plan decisions (e.g., "does BullMQ support X?"):
- **Simple lookup** (single method, single config option, yes/no capability check) → call `resolve-library-id` then `query-docs` directly with the specific question. Append `→ Confirmed: [finding]`. Faster than invoking b-docs as a subagent.
- **Complex lookup** (multi-area, version comparison, migration path) → invoke `b-docs` as before.
Do not defer verifiable library assumptions to Session 2.

If the plan has open tool/approach decisions (`compare`, `decide between`, `which library`, `evaluate`, or `?`):
- **Quick comparison** (2 options, single criterion) → call `brave_web_search` with a focused query (e.g. `"BullMQ vs Agenda.js reliability comparison"`) and resolve inline. Append findings to Unknowns.
- **Deep comparison** (multiple criteria, performance benchmarks, multi-source) → invoke `b-research` as before.
Do not defer tool selection to execution.

An unresolved unknown is a risk. Surface it now, not halfway through implementation.

---

### Step 4 — Write plan to current project root

Write the plan to `.opencode/b-plans/[task-slug].md` in the **current root project only**.

- `task-slug` = kebab-case of the task name, e.g. `add-retry-logic`, `refactor-auth-module`.
- Always resolve the active working tree / current project root first, then write under `<current-project-root>/.opencode/b-plans/`.
- Never write plan files to the user home directory, a parent workspace folder, another repo, or any shared/global directory.
- Create `.opencode/b-plans/` inside the current project root if it doesn't exist.
- Show the exact saved path to the user after writing.

Then present a short summary in chat (scope + step count) and ask for confirmation.

If the user requests changes → update the file, then confirm again.
If the user confirms → do NOT execute in this session. Instead, print:

```
✅ Plan saved to .opencode/b-plans/[task-slug].md

To execute: open a new session and run:
  execute plan from .opencode/b-plans/[task-slug].md
```

---

## Plan file format

Language: always English — write plan files in English regardless of the user's query language.

```markdown
# Plan: [task name]

**Scope**: [one sentence — what this plan covers]
**End state**: [what "done" looks like]
**Created**: [date]
**Issue**: [URL, ticket ID, or omit this line entirely if not applicable]

---

## Steps

- [ ] 1. [Step name]
  - What: ...
  - Why now: ...
  - Done when: ...

- [ ] 2. [Step name]
  - What: ...
  - Why now: ...
  - Done when: ...

...

## Dependencies
- Step 3 requires Step 1 to be complete
- Steps 4 and 5 can run in parallel

## Risks
- [Risk]: [mitigation or fallback]

## Unknowns *(resolve before starting)*
- Need b-docs: [library] — [what to verify]
- Need decision: [question for user]
- Assuming: [assumption that may not hold]

## Feasibility *(optional — only if Step 0 was run)*
**Effort**: [S/M/L/XL/XXL]
**Blockers**: [none / description]
**Assumptions confirmed**: [list]

## Last Gate Failure
<!-- populated by b-execute-plan when b-gate fails -->

## Review Feedback
<!-- populated by b-execute-plan when b-review returns NEEDS FIXES -->
```

## Execution (in a new session)

Plan files are always in English. When a new session opens, run: `execute plan from .opencode/b-plans/[file].md` — b-execute-plan orchestrates the full pipeline automatically with state tracking and rollback support.

Pipeline overview (b-execute-plan handles all of this):

0. **Pre-execution** *(conditional)*: if plan modifies existing code and no `## Context` section exists → extract file paths from plan Steps, run `b-analyze` scoped to only those paths, append as `## Context`. Skip if greenfield or context already present.
1. **Per implementation step** → invoke `@b-tdd [plan-file]:[N]` (single-step mode: runs exactly step N, checks it off, returns control). b-tdd enforces Iron Law + RGR per step.
2. **After all implementation steps** → invoke `@b-gate` (no args — runs on full working tree).
3. **After b-gate passes** → invoke `@b-review [plan-file]` (passes plan as requirements baseline).
4. **After READY FOR PR** → invoke `@b-commit`.
5. **Non-production steps** (config, docs, delete, migrate, rename): perform manually, signal `done` — no agent invoked.
6. **On step failure**: b-execute-plan writes `[❌] N — reason`, checks `git diff --stat` for partial changes, offers `git checkout -- .` rollback, blocks dependent steps from running.
7. **On NEEDS FIXES from b-review**: b-execute-plan verifies real code changes via `git diff HEAD --stat` before resetting b-gate checkpoint — never resets on verbal signal alone.

Session step count is derived from the file — each step runs via subagent so the main session stays token-light throughout execution.

## Rules

- Always write to `.opencode/b-plans/` — never output the plan only in chat for non-trivial tasks.
- Always write plan files in English — regardless of the user's query language.
- Never execute in the same session as planning — always save to a plan file and open a new session with b-execute-plan.
- Steps must be ordered by dependency — wrong order causes cascading failures.
- Keep steps atomic — one clear action per step, not "implement the whole service layer.".
- If a step requires a b-docs or b-research call, mark it explicitly in the Unknowns section.
- Surface risks and assumptions proactively — a wrong assumption found at Step 1 is free; found at Step 7 it costs a rewrite.
- If the task turns out to require 10+ steps, split it into phases — one plan file per phase.
- During execution, check off steps as completed and update the file in real time.
- Never trigger destructive git commands — no `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, `git checkout -- <file>`, or `git branch -D`. If a commit is needed after completing work, delegate to b-commit.
