$ARGUMENTS

All external knowledge in one agent: classify query → fetch versioned library docs via
Context7 (for API/HOWTO queries) → search with type-specific strategy via Brave Search →
scrape full content via Firecrawl → synthesize into a report with citations.

Handles both quick library lookups ("how do I use Prisma transactions?") and deep
multi-source research ("compare BullMQ vs Bee-Queue for job queues").

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as the research question — proceed directly to Step 1 (classify query type) using the provided text. Do not ask the user to restate their question.

## When to use

- User asks how to use a specific library, SDK, or framework feature.
- User asks "does X support Y?", "what's the API for X?", "how to configure X?".
- Before implementing code that calls an external library — verify the API first.
- User asks to research, compare, or deeply understand a topic.
- User wants a report or summary of multiple sources.
- User says: "tìm hiểu", "research", "deep dive", "so sánh", "tổng hợp", "how to use X",
  "cách dùng", "tra cứu", "viết report về".

## When NOT to use

- Quick one-fact lookup (latest version, price, single answer) → call `brave_web_search` or `brave_news_search` directly
- Daily news digest → call `brave_news_search` directly and format a digest
- Debugging a broken library call → use **b-debug**

## Tools required

- `brave_web_search` — from `brave-search` MCP server (required, general search)
- `brave_news_search` — from `brave-search` MCP server *(required for NEWS-type queries; use instead of `brave_web_search` for time-sensitive topics)*
- `firecrawl_scrape` — from `firecrawl` MCP server (required, scrape individual pages)
- `firecrawl_search` — from `firecrawl` MCP server *(optional, single-call search+scrape fallback when `brave_web_search` returns <3 results)*
- `firecrawl_map` — from `firecrawl` MCP server *(optional, discover correct URLs when `firecrawl_scrape` returns empty content)*
- `firecrawl_crawl` + `firecrawl_check_crawl_status` — from `firecrawl` MCP server *(optional, async deep multi-page crawl for documentation sites)*
- `resolve-library-id` + `query-docs` — from `context7` MCP server *(optional, for library/framework API topics)*
- `sequentialthinking` — from `sequential-thinking` MCP server *(optional, for structured conflict resolution)*
- `task` tool (Explore subagent) *(optional, for Step 4 when ≥ 4 URLs need scraping — spawn one subagent to run all scrapes in parallel and return a compact digest)* — spawn a single Explore subagent with the selected URL list and original research question. The subagent runs all `firecrawl_scrape` calls in parallel, applies the post-scrape quality gate, and returns only relevant excerpts (max 500 words per source, with source URL). Main context receives the compact digest and proceeds directly to Step 5 without raw scraped content flooding the context. When < 4 URLs, use direct parallel scraping as before.

If brave-search or firecrawl is unavailable, stop and tell the user:
- brave-search missing: "❌ brave-search MCP is not connected. Please check `/mcp`.".
- firecrawl missing: "❌ firecrawl MCP is not connected. Please check `/mcp`.".

If context7 is unavailable on a library/framework topic, skip Step 2 silently and continue with Step 3.
If task tool is unavailable: use direct parallel `firecrawl_scrape` calls in the main context as before (existing behavior).

Graceful degradation: ❌ Not possible — this agent requires live web data (brave-search + firecrawl). If either MCP is unavailable, stop and tell the user. task tool unavailability: ✅ graceful — falls back to direct parallel scraping.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Classify query type

Classify the user's query into **one of four types** before doing anything else. The type determines the entire search strategy.

| Type | Signals | Strategy |
|------|---------|----------|
| **VERSION** | "latest version", "what's new", "changelog", "release notes", "current version of X" | Official docs FIRST via direct scrape, then web search |
| **COMPARE** | "vs", "so sánh", "which is better", "A or B", "compare X and Y" | 2 balanced searches (one per option), equal coverage of both sides |
| **NEWS** | "recent", "2025/2026", "mới nhất", "latest news", "what happened", time-sensitive topics | `brave_news_search` with `freshness: "pd"` or `"pw"` |
| **HOWTO / API** | "how to", "cách dùng", "tutorial", "setup", "configure", asking about API usage | Context7 first (Step 2), then scrape official docs + community |

**If topic is library/framework API → also run Step 2 (Context7) before Step 3.**
**All other types → skip Step 2, go to Step 3.**

---

### Step 2 — Context7 lookup *(HOWTO/API type only)*

> **Session optimization**: If Context7 has already been queried for this library in the current session, reuse those findings — do not call it again.

**Version detection** — before querying docs, attempt to find the exact installed version:
- Check `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` in the project root.
- If version contains a range (`^`, `~`, `>=`, `*`), check the lockfile for the exact resolved version.
- If no manifest found, proceed without version constraint and note: `⚠️ No manifest found — docs may not match installed version.`

Use `resolve-library-id` to find the correct Context7 library ID, then `query-docs` to fetch version-accurate documentation.

- Set `topic` to the specific feature or API area relevant to the user's question.
- Fetch enough tokens to cover the relevant API surface (default: 8000–12000 tokens).
- If `resolve-library-id` returns no match → skip to Step 3 (web search). Note it in the report.
- If Context7 returns docs for a different major version than detected → flag explicitly: "⚠️ Context7 returned docs for vX but project uses vY — API may differ."
- Skip this step if user's question is clearly recency-dependent (e.g., "what changed in v5?") — Context7 may be stale for recent releases.
- **Do not use Context7 output as the sole source** — it provides API accuracy; web sources provide real-world usage and community feedback.

**For simple library lookups** (single method, config key, or yes/no capability check): if Context7 returns a clear answer, you may stop here and present the result using the Library Lookup output format below — no need to proceed to web search.

---

### Step 3 — Search (type-specific strategy)

Apply the strategy for the query type identified in Step 1:

**VERSION queries:**
- If the tool has a known official docs/changelog URL → use `firecrawl_scrape` on it DIRECTLY first (skip to Step 4 for this URL), then use Brave to find community context.
- If official URL is unknown → search with: `"[tool name] official changelog [year]"` or `"[tool name] release notes site:[official-domain]"`
- Always include `official` or `changelog` in the query to avoid third-party aggregators.
- Third-party version trackers (deepwiki, community changelogs) have staleness lag of 1–3 weeks — treat them as supplementary only, not authoritative.

**COMPARE queries:**
- Run **2 separate Brave searches**: one focused on option A, one on option B (in parallel)
- Pick sources that cover each option from its own perspective (official docs, official blog)
- Pick at least 1 neutral comparison source (benchmarks, independent reviews)
- Ensure balanced coverage: minimum 1 authoritative source per option being compared.
- Up to 7 URLs may be scraped for comparison queries to ensure balance (exception to the 5-URL default)

**NEWS queries:**
- Use `brave_news_search` (not `brave_web_search`) with `freshness: "pd"` (last 24h) or `freshness: "pw"` (last 7 days)
- Freshness options: `"pd"` = past day, `"pw"` = past week, `"pm"` = past month, `"py"` = past year — start with `"pd"`, broaden to `"pw"` if fewer than 3 results.
- Include the current year in the query.
- Prefer official announcements, official blogs, and reputable tech press over aggregators.

**HOWTO / API queries:**
- After Context7 (Step 2), use Brave to find community tutorials and real-world examples.
- Query should include the library name + version + specific feature.
- Deprioritize official doc URLs in Brave if Context7 already covered them well.

**Universal search rules (all types):**
- Use English queries unless the topic is Vietnamese-specific.
- Fetch 5–8 results from Brave.
- **Pick 3 highest-quality URLs** using the source quality hierarchy below (quality over quantity: 3 Tier-1 sources > 5 mixed-tier sources).
- **Fallback**: If `brave_web_search` returns fewer than 3 relevant results, retry with `firecrawl_search` using the same query — it returns full page content directly, skip Step 4 for those results.

**Source quality hierarchy (prefer top tiers):**
1. Official docs, official changelogs, official GitHub repo
2. Official team blog, official announcements
3. Well-known tech publications (The Verge, Ars Technica, HN top posts, official SDK examples)
4. Community Q&A (StackOverflow answers with high votes, GitHub Discussions)
5. Independent technical blogs with clear authorship
6. Third-party aggregators, trackers, wikis ← treat as supplementary only

**Avoid**: Pinterest, SEO-farm content mills, AI-generated listicles, paywalled pages (unless the snippet is already sufficient).

---

### Step 4 — Scrape

**Context isolation threshold**: if ≥ 4 URLs need scraping → spawn a single Explore subagent (see below). If < 4 URLs → use direct parallel `firecrawl_scrape` calls in main context. (With smart source selection keeping typical queries to 3 URLs, subagent spawn is rare — reduces context overhead.)

---

**When ≥ 4 URLs — spawn a single Explore subagent**

Pass to the subagent:
1. The list of selected URLs to scrape
2. The original research question

The subagent runs all `firecrawl_scrape` calls in parallel (`formats: ["markdown"]`, `onlyMainContent: true`), applies the full post-scrape quality gate (discards pages with < 300 words of relevant content, retries JS-heavy pages with `waitFor: 5000/8000`, uses `firecrawl_map` for empty pages), and returns a compact digest: relevant excerpt per source (max 500 words), source URL, and discard notes. Main context receives this digest and proceeds to Step 5 without raw scraped content in context.

---

**Pre-scrape filtering** (before Step 4, eliminate low-value URLs):
- Remove from scrape queue:
  - Homepage or landing page (no specific content)
  - Pages requiring login/authentication
  - Tutorial/guide when user asked for API specs or comparisons (skip tutorials for spec queries)
  - Third-party aggregators or version trackers (use official source instead)
  - Paywalled pages with paywall message visible
- **Goal**: scrape only high-signal sources → saves 1–2K tokens by avoiding trash content

---

**When < 4 URLs — scrape directly in main context**

- Call `firecrawl_scrape` on all selected URLs **in parallel** (single message, multiple tool calls)
- Use `formats: ["markdown"]`, `onlyMainContent: true` to get clean content without boilerplate.
- **Fallback for JS-heavy pages** (SPAs, Mintlify/GitBook docs, React-rendered pages): if content is empty or <200 words after one retry with `waitFor: 5000` → skip and note in report as "could not scrape — JS-rendered or access denied". (Removed retry with `waitFor: 8000` and `firecrawl_map` fallback to save tokens — not worth the cost for marginal improvement.)
- If a page returns rate-limit or 403 → skip it and note in report.
- Default max: **3 URLs** scraped per session (quality > quantity). Exception: **5 URLs** for COMPARE queries (ensure balanced coverage of both options — 2–3 per side).
- If rate-limiting occurs on parallel calls, retry failed URLs sequentially.

**Deep multi-page crawl** *(for documentation sites — use when you need comprehensive coverage of a multi-page doc, not just a single article)*:
1. Call `firecrawl_crawl` on the documentation root URL with `limit: 10–20` pages
2. Poll `firecrawl_check_crawl_status` every few seconds until `status: "completed"` — do NOT proceed until crawl is done
3. Use the returned pages as your source set; apply the post-scrape quality gate below

**Post-scrape quality gate** (strict filtering — do this before synthesizing):
- For each scraped page, check: does the content actually address the user's question?
- **Discard immediately** if: < 300 words of relevant content AND topic is not mentioned → note "low-quality source discarded"
- **Discard if** > 50% boilerplate (nav, footer, ads, sidebars) and < 200 unique content words → note "mostly boilerplate"
- **If fewer than 2 usable sources remain after discarding** → STOP. Tell user: "Couldn't find enough reliable sources on this topic. Try being more specific or rephrasing the question." Do NOT blindly scrape more URLs.
- **Exception**: For COMPARE queries where sources explicitly disagree, retain >1 source per option even if marginal, to preserve conflicting perspectives.

---

### Step 5 — Synthesize

- Read all sources (Context7 output + scraped content) carefully.
- **Answer from actual scraped content only** — if no source explicitly covers a fact, do NOT fill the gap from training data. Instead, flag it in the `Limitations` section.
- Note the publication/update date of each source when available — use it to assess freshness.
- If 2 or more sources recommend conflicting approaches for the same decision point → call `sequentialthinking` with: "Source A says [X] because [reason]. Source B says [Y] because [reason]. Given the user's context of [task], which approach is more applicable and why?" Include the structured reasoning in a "⚖️ Conflicting findings" subsection.
- If sources conflict on minor details only, note the disagreement inline without calling `sequentialthinking`
- For VERSION queries: always note the official source version separately from any third-party tracker versions if they differ.
- Produce a structured report (see output format below)

## Rules

- Always scrape — never rely on search snippets alone.
- Apply query type routing from Step 1 — do not use a generic one-size-fits-all search strategy.
- For VERSION queries: official docs via direct scrape takes priority over any search result.
- For COMPARE queries: ensure balanced source coverage — do not let one option dominate.
- For library/framework API topics: always attempt Context7 before scraping.
- Default max 3 URLs; 5 URLs allowed for COMPARE queries (balanced coverage of both options).
- Cite every claim with its source URL or "Context7 (`library-name`)".
- Never state a fact not found in scraped content — use the `Limitations` section for gaps.
- Label each source as `[Official]`, `[Community]`, or `[Blog]` in the Sources list.
- For time-sensitive data (versions, prices, availability): always note the source's date and link to official source for verification.
- If the user asks a specific question, answer it directly in the Summary before going into detail.
- Keep the report focused — omit irrelevant scraped content.
- Note any sources that failed to scrape or were discarded so the user can check manually.
- Never trigger destructive git commands — no `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, or `git checkout -- <file>`.
