# b-quick-search

Single-call web lookup via Brave Search. Fast, cited, no scraping.
The rule is simple: one search call, one clean answer.

## When to use

- User says: "search", "tìm", "look up", "find", "tìm nhanh", "latest X", "current X".
- Queries about: latest versions, recent news, current prices, new releases, CVEs.
- Any question where training data might be stale and one search is enough.
- User explicitly says `b-quick-search` or "use brave search".

## When NOT to use

- User wants a deep dive, comparison, or multi-source report → use **b-research**
- Topic is a library/framework and the user wants API details → use **b-docs**
- The answer clearly requires reading full articles, not just search snippets.
- User wants a grouped daily news digest → use **b-news** (b-quick-search returns a single news answer, b-news returns a categorized digest)

## Tools required

- `brave_web_search` — from `brave-search` MCP server (required, for general queries)
- `brave_news_search` — from `brave-search` MCP server *(required for news/current-events queries — use instead of `brave_web_search` when query is about recent events, breaking news, or time-sensitive topics)*

If unavailable: stop and tell the user:
"❌ brave-search MCP is not connected. Please check `/mcp`."
Do NOT substitute with any other search tool or training data.

Graceful degradation: ❌ Not possible — this agent requires live web data. If the MCP is unavailable, stop and tell the user.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Route and search

**Choose the right tool before searching:**
- **News / current events** (breaking news, recent announcements, "what happened with X", "latest news on Y") → use `brave_news_search` with `freshness: "pd"` (past day) or `"pw"` (past week)
- **Everything else** (versions, prices, docs, CVEs, definitions) → use `brave_web_search`

Call the selected tool with:
- A focused, specific query (1–6 words works best)
- `count: 5` — enough for a quick lookup, not overwhelming.
- English queries unless the topic is Vietnamese-specific.

If the first query returns no useful results, retry once with a rephrased query.
Rephrasing tips: add the current year, replace ambiguous words with specific technical terms (e.g. "fix" → "patch", "tool" → the exact product name), add the full product/company name, or remove generic qualifiers like "best" or "how to".
If the retry also fails → tell the user the search returned no relevant results
and suggest they try b-research for a deeper lookup.

### Step 2 — Synthesize

Do NOT dump raw results. Write a clean, direct response:
- Lead with the direct answer (from summarizer if available, otherwise from search snippets)
- Include version numbers and dates when relevant.
- Group related findings if results cover multiple aspects.
- Cite sources at the end.

## Output format

```
[Direct answer]

Key findings:
- Finding 1 (source title if needed)
- Finding 2

Sources:
- [Title](URL)
- [Title](URL)
```

For single-fact lookups (e.g. "latest version of X"), skip "Key findings" and
just answer directly with one source citation inline.

## Rules

- Maximum 2 search calls — one primary, one retry if needed. This is still a quick lookup, not a full research session.
- Never use training data as the answer — always search first.
- Never substitute another tool if brave-search is unavailable.
- Keep answers concise — no need to reproduce full article content.
- If results are insufficient for a confident answer, say so and suggest b-research.
