# b-observe

Audit source code for observability gaps — statically, without running the system.
Surfaces missing log statements, silently swallowed errors, absent metrics instrumentation,
and missing tracing context propagation so they can be fixed before they hide incidents.

## When to use

- Before a production deploy: verify critical paths are instrumented.
- During code review: check that new code carries logging, error reporting, and tracing.
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar service: map what is and isn't observable.
- User says: "observability audit", "find missing logs", "kiểm tra log", "tìm lỗi bị nuốt", "tracing coverage".

## When NOT to use

- Runtime performance profiling (CPU, memory, latency measurements) — requires a live system → use a profiler.
- Structured log format validation (log levels, schema) — that's a lint concern → use b-gate.
- General code quality review → use **b-analyze**.
- Something is broken right now → use **b-debug**.

## Tools required

From `jcodemunch` MCP server:
- `resolve_repo`, `index_folder` — index or resolve the local codebase before querying.
- `get_session_stats` — verify index freshness before auditing instrumentation coverage.
- `suggest_queries` — auto-surface likely service entry points before auditing instrumentation gaps.
- `get_ranked_context` — pack the most relevant handlers/jobs/boundary files into a bounded context window before auditing.
- `search_text` — find log/trace/metric call patterns and detect their absence in error handlers.
- `find_references` — find all usages of logger, tracer, and metrics objects to map instrumented vs uninstrumented call sites.
- `get_symbol_source` — read full source of error handlers, request handlers, and service entry points.
- `get_file_outline` — batch-inspect files for function signatures to identify all error-handling functions.
- `get_repo_outline` — understand module structure to scope the audit.

From `context7` MCP server *(optional, for instrumentation library docs)*:
- `resolve-library-id` — resolve the detected logger/tracer/metrics library name to a Context7 ID.
- `query-docs` — fetch correct API patterns for the instrumentation library found in Step 2 (e.g. correct structured log call signature for `winston`, span attribute conventions for `opentelemetry`, counter naming for `prom-client`). Use before Step 3 to know what "correct instrumentation" looks like before declaring a gap.

From `brave-search` MCP server *(optional, for observability best-practice lookup)*:
- `brave_web_search` — look up instrumentation best practices for named patterns found during the audit (e.g. `"winston structured logging best practices"`, `"opentelemetry span naming conventions"`, `"prometheus counter vs gauge"`). Use in Step 6 to make remediation suggestions concrete rather than generic.

From `sequential-thinking` MCP server *(optional)*:
- `sequentialthinking` — prioritize findings by impact and produce an ordered remediation list.

If jcodemunch is unavailable: use `Grep` to search for log/trace patterns and `Read` to inspect error handlers directly. Note limitation: cross-file reference tracking will be incomplete — flag this in the report.
If context7 is unavailable: proceed with knowledge of the library's API from codebase usage patterns found via jcodemunch/Grep.
If brave-search is unavailable: omit best-practice lookup in Step 6 and provide generic remediation guidance.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — Grep/Read can cover most patterns. jcodemunch improves completeness, context7 validates correct patterns, brave-search enriches remediation advice. All optional.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Define audit scope

Confirm:
- **Target**: specific service, module, or layer (e.g., "the payment service", "all HTTP handlers", "background job workers").
- **Stack**: what logging, metrics, and tracing libraries are in use? (e.g., `winston`, `structlog`, `zap`, `OpenTelemetry`, `Prometheus`).

If the user says "audit everything" without further context, ask which service or layer matters most — a full-repo audit produces noise on large codebases.

Run the standard jcodemunch preflight (see `global/AGENTS.md § jcodemunch preflight`) with query = "[audit target — e.g. 'payment service HTTP handlers observability']". Use the returned ranked context to prioritize handlers/jobs/boundary files. Then call `get_repo_outline` to understand module layout before narrowing scope.

---

### Step 2 — Detect instrumentation libraries

Before auditing gaps, identify what's available:

**Logging** — search for import patterns:
```
search_text(query="import.*logger|require.*logger|import.*log |from.*logging|import.*winston|import.*pino|import.*zap|import.*structlog", is_regex=true)
```

**Metrics** — search for:
```
search_text(query="prometheus|statsd|metrics\.|counter\.|histogram\.|gauge\.", is_regex=true)
```

**Tracing** — search for:
```
search_text(query="opentelemetry|tracer\.|startSpan|trace\.|context\.with|propagat", is_regex=true)
```

For each found library, use `find_references` on the primary logger/tracer/metrics symbol to map which files are instrumented. Files with zero references to any instrumentation library are candidates for Step 3.

**Context7 lookup** *(once library is identified)*: call `resolve-library-id` then `query-docs` for the detected library with query = "[library name] structured logging / span attributes / counter labels" to establish what correct instrumentation looks like. This is the reference baseline for declaring a gap in Steps 3–5. Skip if library is standard built-in (e.g. Python `logging`).

---

### Step 3 — Find missing log statements

**Error handlers with no log call** — these swallow failures silently:

Use `search_text` to locate all catch/except blocks:
```
search_text(query="catch\s*\(|except\s+|rescue\s+|\.catch\(", is_regex=true)
```

For each match, use `get_symbol_source` with `context_lines=5` to read the surrounding handler body. Flag blocks where:
- The body contains only a re-throw (`throw e`, `raise`) with no log call before it.
- The body is empty or contains only a comment.
- The body calls `console.error` / `print` instead of the structured logger (degrades observability).

**Entry and exit of critical operations** — check request handlers, job processors, and external service calls for missing start/end log events:

```
search_text(query="async function|def handle|func Handle|public.*Controller|@PostMapping|@app\.(get|post|put|delete)", is_regex=true)
```

For each match, check if the function body contains at least one log call.

---

### Step 4 — Find missing metrics instrumentation

Identify paths that should increment a counter or record a histogram but don't:

1. Find all HTTP handlers, job handlers, and external API call sites using `get_file_outline`.
2. For each handler: use `get_symbol_source` and check whether the function body calls a metrics increment/observe/record function.
3. Flag handlers that process requests or complete work without recording any metric.

Common missing points:
- Request count / error count per endpoint.
- Job success / failure counters.
- External dependency call durations.
- Queue depth or processing lag.

---

### Step 5 — Find missing tracing context propagation

If a tracing library was detected in Step 2:

1. Use `find_references` on the tracer/span symbols to list all instrumented functions.
2. Use `get_file_outline` on service-boundary files (HTTP handlers, message consumers, scheduled jobs) — these should always start a trace span.
3. Flag service entry points that don't call `startSpan` / `trace.getTracer` / equivalent.
4. Use `search_text` to find context propagation patterns (HTTP header injection/extraction):
   ```
   search_text(query="traceparent|W3C|propagat|inject|extract|carrier", is_regex=true)
   ```
   Flag HTTP clients that do not inject trace context into outgoing requests.

---

### Step 6 — Prioritize and report

If sequential-thinking is available, call `sequentialthinking` with:
> "Given these observability gaps [list from Steps 3–5], rank the top 5 by incident impact. Which gaps would cause the most confusion during an outage — where would an on-call engineer be flying blind?"

Use the result to produce an **Ordered remediation list** at the top of Recommended Next Steps.

**Best-practice enrichment** *(for High findings only)*: for each 🔴 High finding that involves a named pattern (e.g. swallowed error in express middleware, missing span on gRPC handler, no request counter on REST endpoint), call `brave_web_search` with `"[library name] [pattern] observability best practice"`. Use the result to make the remediation suggestion concrete: specify the correct API call, not just "add logging here".

## Output format

```
### b-observe: [target — service, module, or layer]

**Scope**: [files/modules audited]
**Stack detected**: [logging lib] / [metrics lib] / [tracing lib] / [none detected]

---

**Missing log statements**

🔴 High — [function]: [file:line] — catch block with no log call → add `logger.error(err)` before re-throw or return
🟡 Medium — [function]: [file:line] — silent null return on error path → add `logger.warn(...)` with context
🟢 Low — [function]: [file:line] — uses `console.error` instead of structured logger → replace with `logger.error`

**Missing metrics**

🔴 High — [handler]: [file:line] — HTTP 5xx path not counted → add error counter increment
🟡 Medium — [handler]: [file:line] — job completion not recorded → add success/failure counter

**Missing tracing**

🔴 High — [entry point]: [file:line] — no span started on inbound request → add `tracer.startActiveSpan(...)`
🟡 Medium — [http client call]: [file:line] — trace context not injected into outgoing request headers

---

**Metrics snapshot**
- Functions audited: N
- Functions with no log: N (N%)
- Functions with no metric: N (N%)
- Entry points with no trace span: N

**Recommended next steps** (ordered by on-call impact)
1. [Most critical gap first]
2. ...
```

## Rules

- **Static only**: never suggest runtime profiling, live log sampling, or APM configuration — those require live systems. Flag them as out of scope.
- **Findings must be specific**: file + function + reason, not "logging is missing everywhere".
- **Don't fix during audit**: this agent produces a findings report. Hand off to b-plan for remediation sequencing.
- **Scope before auditing**: always confirm target layer or service first — a full-repo scan on a large project produces noise.
- **Distinguish swallowed errors from re-thrown**: a handler that re-throws without logging is a gap, but less severe than one that returns without logging — note the difference in severity.
- **console.log is not structured logging**: flag `console.log/error/warn` as Medium (not High) — it's observable, but degrades log quality in production.
- **If no instrumentation library detected**: flag this as 🔴 High at the top of the report — the service has zero observability, not just gaps.
- Never trigger destructive git commands — no `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, `git checkout -- <file>`, or `git branch -D`. If a commit is needed after completing work, delegate to b-commit.
