name: b-execute-plan
description: Orchestrates the full development pipeline (b-tdd → b-gate → b-review → b-commit) by reading plan files, tracking step completion, and invoking subagents for each stage. Use for "execute plan", "chạy plan", "thực thi kế hoạch", "run plan".

## Subagent invocation

**State bridging between subagents**: before invoking each subagent, write relevant context to the plan file so the subagent has what it needs:
- Before `@b-tdd`: ensure `## Context` section exists (from b-analyze output).
- After `@b-gate` fails: write error output to `## Last Gate Failure` section, then pass to `@b-debug`.
- After `@b-review` returns NEEDS FIXES: write feedback to `## Review Feedback` section, then pass to `@b-tdd`.

# b-execute-plan

Reads `.opencode/b-plans/*.md` files, parses step state, and guides users through the production development pipeline with explicit checkpoints and state tracking.

## When to use
- User says "execute plan" or provides a plan file path
- Running b-tdd → b-gate → b-review → b-commit pipeline with guided orchestration
- Need step-by-step state management and checkpoint verification

## When NOT to use
- User wants to create a plan (use `b-plan` instead)
- Running a single agent in isolation (use `@b-tdd`, `@b-gate`, etc. directly)

## Tools required
- File listing — discover `.opencode/b-plans/*.md` files
- File read — load and parse plan file content
- File edit — update checkbox state (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`)
- Subagent invocation — invoke downstream agents via `@` mention
- `Bash` — run `git diff HEAD --stat` for rollback detection

If a subagent is unavailable: prompt user to run the corresponding agent manually; checkpoint tracking still works via file read/edit.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — core pipeline always works.

## Steps

---

### Phase 1 — LoadPlan

**Input**: plan file path (from argument or Glob discovery)
**Output**: `{plan_file, steps[], baseline_completed, pending_steps_count}`
**Decisions**: fresh start vs resume; Step 0 (pre-analysis) trigger

#### Step 0 — Pre-execution analysis *(conditional)*

**Skip immediately** if either is true:
- Plan is greenfield (no existing modules are changed)
- `## Context` section already exists in the plan file and is still valid for the current plan scope

**Require Step 0** only when the plan modifies existing code **and at least one risk trigger is true**:
- Scope is ambiguous, broad, or not tied to clear files/modules yet
- Code area is unfamiliar or spans more than 2 files / multiple layers
- Change touches shared utilities, public APIs, core flows, or high-blast-radius modules
- Existing `## Context` is missing, stale, incomplete, or mismatched to the current plan scope

**Skip Step 0** for small, local, well-scoped existing-code changes (typically 1–2 files, one layer, low blast radius) when the plan already has valid matching context.

Never auto-invoke `@b-analyze`. Ask the user first whenever Step 0 is required.

**Determine scope before asking:**
1. Scan `## Steps` for explicit file paths or backtick module names.
2. If found → scope to exactly those files/directories.
3. If not → parse the plan's **Scope** for module/layer names.
4. If the repo can be resolved with jcodemunch, use `resolve_repo` as a cached repo map lookup and call `get_ranked_context` with the plan title + scope as the query. Use the top-ranked files/symbols to refine the analysis scope.
5. If still ambiguous → ask: "Which module or directory should I analyze?"

If the existing `## Context` appears stale, incomplete, or mismatched to the current plan scope, treat it as missing and re-evaluate the risk triggers above.

**Ask before running** (never auto-invoke, only when Step 0 is required):
```
Run b-analyze on [resolved scope] before starting?
This builds codebase context for the execution (~5–10k tokens).
  y — run analysis
  n — skip (save tokens, start pipeline immediately)
```
Wait for user response. If `n`: skip Step 0 entirely and proceed to Step 1.

If `y`: invoke `@b-analyze` scoped to the resolved paths. Prefer the refined scope from `get_ranked_context` over broad module names when available. Append output as a `## Context` section to the plan file.

#### Step 1 — Locate and load plan file

Detect plan file from:
1. Argument passed by user (e.g., `execute plan from .opencode/b-plans/file.md`)
2. If no argument: list all `.opencode/b-plans/*.md` files.
   - If exactly one file exists → use it automatically.
   - If multiple files exist → list all with last-modified timestamps and ask which to execute.
3. If no files found → ask the user to provide the plan file path.

Read the selected plan file.

**Session resume**: if the plan file already has completed steps (`[x]`), automatically resume from the first pending (`[ ]`) step.

**Session step counter**: count existing `[x]` checkboxes → store as `baseline_completed`.

#### Step 2 — Parse plan structure and extract step checkboxes

Extract all lines matching:
- `- [ ] N. [description]` or `- [x] N. [description]`
- `- [ ] Step N — [description]` or `- [x] Step N — [description]`
- `- [❌] N. [description]` (failed state)

Build state map: `{step_number: {description, status: "pending" | "completed" | "failed"}}`.

---

### Phase 2 — SelectNextStep

**Input**: `{steps[]}`
**Output**: `{step_N, agent_route, is_manual, is_blocked}`
**Decisions**: dependency check; keyword routing (priority table); default fallback to `@b-tdd`; ask only when step text has no actionable routing signal

Show:
- Plan title and summary
- Completed steps (✓), failed steps (❌ — show prominently), pending steps (○)
- Next step to run

**Agent routing** — match keywords in next step's description (check top-to-bottom, stop at first match). If no higher-priority rule matches, default to `@b-tdd`:

| Priority | Keyword(s) | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (first) | "delete", "remove", "config", "migrate", "migration", "document", "update docs", "rename", "move" | Manual step — instruct user, wait for `done` signal |
| 2 | "run tests", "run lint", "validate quality", "quality gate", "check quality", "lint", "typecheck" | `@b-gate` |
| 3 | "review", "verify logic", "requirements coverage" | `@b-review` |
| 4 | "commit", "PR description", "push" | `@b-commit` |
| 5 (last / default) | "implement", "write", "code", "add", "create", "refactor", "build", "extend", "fix" | `@b-tdd` |
| — | no higher-priority match but step still describes implementation work | `@b-tdd` |
| — | step text is too vague to infer any action (for example: "handle this", "take care of it") | Ask: "Which agent for this step? (b-tdd / b-gate / b-review / b-commit / manual)" |

**Routing note**: Priority 2 requires the keyword to be a primary action verb in the step description (e.g. "Run tests and validate quality"), not merely mentioned as part of an implementation step (e.g. "Implement service with unit tests" → Priority 5). When both Priority 2 and Priority 5 keywords are present in the same step, Priority 5 (`@b-tdd`) wins. Treat bug-fix steps as implementation work by default (for example: "Fix pagination bug" → `@b-tdd`).

**Invocation format per subagent:**
- `@b-tdd [plan-file]:[N]` — must run exactly step N
- `@b-gate` — no args (or `src/ path/` to scope)
- `@b-review [plan-file]` — no step number
- `@b-commit` — no args

Show routing decision and invoke immediately (no confirmation for unambiguous or default-routed steps):
```
→ Invoking Step N — [description] via @b-[agent] (keyword match: '[keyword]')
```

**Dependency blocking**: if a prerequisite step M is `[❌]`:
```
⛔ Step N depends on Step M which failed. Resolve Step M before continuing, or type `override` to bypass.
```

**Failed step handling**: if next step has `failed` status:
```
⚠️ Step N previously failed: [reason]. Retry or skip?
- Retry: run @b-[agent] .opencode/b-plans/[file].md:N
- Skip: type `skip` to leave as-is and advance
```

---

### Phase 3 — RunStep

**Input**: `{step_N, agent_route, is_manual}`
**Output**: `{outcome: success | failure | needs_fixes | manual_done}`
**Decisions**: invoke agent vs instruct user; b-gate failure shortcut (offer @b-debug auto-launch for full-loop debug)

Invoke the subagent using the format from Phase 2. Interpret output for success or failure:

- `@b-tdd`: all tests pass and implementation complete
- `@b-gate`: all checks pass (no lint errors, no typecheck failures, all tests green)
- `@b-review`: "READY FOR PR" → outcome = `success`; "NEEDS FIXES" → outcome = `needs_fixes`
- `@b-commit`: commit message generated → outcome = `success`
- **Priority 1 (manual step)**: instruct user, wait for `done`/`next`/`continue` signal → outcome = `manual_done`

**On success / manual_done**: pass `{outcome: success}` directly to Phase 4 — no pause, no output between steps beyond the inline status line. Phase 4 will immediately loop back to Phase 2 for the next step.
**On failure / needs_fixes**: pass `{outcome: failure | needs_fixes}` to Phase 4.

**Happy path flow** (all steps succeed, no issues):
```
Phase 1 (once)
  └─ Load plan, parse steps
  └─ [Step 0 ask — only if conditions met, user answers y/n once]
→ Loop until all steps done:
    Phase 2: select next step → route to agent → invoke immediately
    Phase 3: run subagent → success
    Phase 4: mark [x] → pending steps remain → back to Phase 2  ← no pause here
→ All steps [x]: print summary, exit
```
The entire pipeline from step 1 to final commit runs without any user interaction as long as every subagent returns success.

**b-gate failure shortcut**: if b-gate fails:
1. Extract failing check name and first ~10 lines of error output.
2. Write error to `## Last Gate Failure` section in plan file.
3. Offer:
   ```
   ⚠️ b-gate failed: [failing-check]
   [first ~10 lines of error output]

   Options:
     1 — Auto-launch @b-debug with this error (trace → root cause → fix → verify when possible)
     2 — Fix manually (I'll investigate myself)
   ```
4. If user picks `1`: invoke `@b-debug [key error lines]`. Treat `@b-debug` as full-loop by default: it should investigate, apply the minimal safe fix when available, and state how the fix was verified before returning. Then re-invoke `@b-gate`. If passes, outcome = `success` → proceed to Phase 4.

---

### Phase 4 — HandleOutcome

**Input**: `{outcome, step_N}`
**Output**: plan file updated; next action signal (advance to Phase 2 | block | halt | done)
**Decisions**: success → mark `[x]`, advance; failure → mark `[❌]`, offer rollback, block dependents; needs_fixes → cosmetic vs new behavior re-entry; all_done → print summary

**On `success` or `manual_done`**:
1. Edit the corresponding checkbox `- [ ]` → `- [x]`.
2. Check if all steps are complete or skipped:
   - All done → show summary, congratulate user, exit, and suggest concrete next steps using explicit subagent names when a suite agent exists for that action. If the latest `@b-review` output surfaced observability follow-up on new handlers/endpoints/jobs, include `run @b-observe: [scope]` as an explicit optional next step. Note any failed/skipped steps.
   - All remaining steps `failed` → surface blocked state — do not loop indefinitely.
   - Pending steps remain → **immediately return to Phase 2 without pausing**.

**On `failure`**:
1. Ask user for a brief reason (one sentence).
2. Edit plan file: write `- [❌] N — [brief reason]` replacing `- [ ]` for the current step.
3. Run `git diff HEAD --stat`. If output shows modified files, present rollback option:
   > "Step N left uncommitted changes. Roll back to clean state before retrying? (`git checkout -- .` resets modified tracked files to last commit.)"
   - If user confirms: instruct them to run `git checkout -- .`, confirm repo is clean before retrying.
   - If user declines: note partial state explicitly.
4. Halt until user resolves it or requests skip.

**On `needs_fixes`** *(b-review returned NEEDS FIXES)*:
1. Write b-review feedback to `## Review Feedback` section in plan file.
2. Do NOT reset automatically — wait for user to signal a fix is applied.
3. Run `git diff HEAD --stat` to verify actual file changes.
   - If empty: inform user "No code changes detected. Please modify and save files before re-entering b-gate."
   - If modified files exist: proceed to step 4.
4. Ask: "Did this fix add new behavior, or was it cosmetic (null check, rename, guard clause, typo)?"
    - **Cosmetic** → reset b-gate `[x]` to `[ ]`, return to Phase 2 → routes to `@b-gate`.
    - **New behavior** → determine affected step N: scan b-review's NEEDS FIXES output for a step number reference; if none found, ask the user "Which step number does this fix belong to?" (one question, required). Return to Phase 2 → routes to `@b-tdd [plan-file]:[N]` for that step. After b-tdd completes, reset b-gate `[x]` to `[ ]` and proceed through b-gate → b-review again.

**Observability follow-up rule**: do not auto-invoke `@b-observe` as a mandatory pipeline stage. Only suggest it when `@b-review` explicitly identifies observability uncertainty or missing instrumentation on newly added endpoints, handlers, jobs, or queue consumers.

## Rules

- **Checkbox updates are automatic**: on step success, update `- [ ]` → `- [x]` immediately without waiting for user approval — this is housekeeping, not a user decision. "User approval" only applies to skipping steps, overriding failures, or marking a step done after a manual action (`done` signal).
- **Warn on skipped steps**: if user requests jumping to a later step, warn that earlier steps will be marked incomplete.
- **Preserve plan file integrity**: validate checkbox syntax before editing; skip malformed lines and log a warning.
- **Invocation format is subagent-specific**: `@b-tdd` gets `[plan-file]:[N]`; `@b-review` gets `[plan-file]`; `@b-gate` and `@b-commit` get no plan args.
- **Rollback on partial failure**: if a step fails after modifying files, always check `git diff HEAD --stat` and offer `git checkout -- .` before retry.
- **NEEDS FIXES requires git evidence**: reset b-gate checkpoint only after `git diff HEAD --stat` confirms actual file changes.
- **Auto-advance on success**: when a step completes successfully, immediately proceed to the next step — no pause, no confirmation, no summary between steps. Only pause for user input on: failure, ambiguous routing, manual steps (Priority 1), or NEEDS FIXES from b-review.
- **Never autonomously trigger destructive git commands** — no `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset --hard`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, or `git branch -D`. Rollback (`git checkout -- .`) must be offered to user, never auto-executed. Commits are always delegated to `@b-commit`.
- **Final suggestions must name subagents explicitly**: never end with generic wording like `review the diff before commit` or `draft a commit message / PR description` when those actions map to suite agents. Prefer `run @b-review to review the diff before commit` and `run @b-commit to draft the commit message and PR description`.
- **`@b-observe` is opt-in follow-up, not an automatic stage**: suggest it only when `@b-review` surfaces observability-specific uncertainty on new entry points or background flows.
