## Tool Mapping (read before following instructions below)

When instructions reference these Claude Code tools, use the OpenCode equivalent:

| Claude Code | OpenCode equivalent |
|---|---|
| `Read` / `Glob` / `Grep` | Read files natively |
| `Edit` / `Write` | Edit files natively |
| `Bash` | Run bash commands natively |
| `Skill tool` → `/b-[name]` | Invoke `@b-[name]` subagent with same arguments |
| `Agent tool` | Spawn subagent via task tool |
| `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` | Skip — plan file manages state |

**Subagent invocation format:**
- `/b-tdd [plan-file]:[N]` → `@b-tdd [plan-file]:[N]`
- `/b-gate` → `@b-gate`
- `/b-review [plan-file]` → `@b-review [plan-file]`
- `/b-commit` → `@b-commit`
- `/b-debug [error]` → `@b-debug [error]`
- `/b-analyze [scope]` → `@b-analyze [scope]`

**State bridging between subagents**: before invoking each subagent, write relevant context to the plan file so the subagent has what it needs:
- Before `@b-tdd`: ensure `## Context` section exists (from b-analyze output).
- After `@b-gate` fails: write error output to `## Last Gate Failure` section, then pass to `@b-debug`.
- After `@b-review` returns NEEDS FIXES: write feedback to `## Review Feedback` section, then pass to `@b-tdd`.

# b-execute-plan

Reads `.claude/b-plans/*.md` files, parses step state, and guides users through the production development pipeline with explicit checkpoints and state tracking.

## When to use
- User says "execute plan" or provides a plan file path
- Running b-tdd → b-gate → b-review → b-commit pipeline with guided orchestration
- Need step-by-step state management and checkpoint verification

## When NOT to use
- User wants to create a plan (use `b-plan` instead)
- Running a single skill in isolation (use `@b-tdd`, `@b-gate`, etc. directly)

## Tools required
- File listing — discover `.claude/b-plans/*.md` files
- File read — load and parse plan file content
- File edit — update checkbox state (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`)
- Subagent invocation — invoke downstream skills via `@` mention
- `Bash` — run `git diff HEAD --stat` for rollback detection

If a subagent is unavailable: prompt user to run the corresponding skill manually; checkpoint tracking still works via file read/edit.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — core pipeline always works.

## Steps

### Step 0 — Pre-execution analysis *(conditional)*

Run if: the plan modifies existing code AND no `## Context` section exists in the plan file.
Skip if: plan is greenfield OR `## Context` already present.

1. Scan the plan's `## Steps` section for explicit file paths.
2. If explicit paths found → invoke `@b-analyze` scoped to exactly those files.
3. If no explicit paths → parse the plan's **Scope** for module/layer names and scope to those directories.
4. If scope still ambiguous → ask: "Which module or directory should I analyze before starting?"

Append b-analyze output as a `## Context` section to the plan file.

### Step 1 — Locate and load plan file

Detect plan file from:
1. Argument passed by user (e.g., `execute plan from .claude/b-plans/file.md`)
2. If no argument: list all `.claude/b-plans/*.md` files.
   - If exactly one file exists → use it automatically.
   - If multiple files exist → list all with last-modified timestamps and ask which to execute.
3. If no files found → ask the user to provide the plan file path.

Read the selected plan file.

**Session resume**: if the plan file already has completed steps (`[x]`), automatically resume from the first pending (`[ ]`) step.

**Context window warning**: after loading, count total pending (`[ ]`) steps. If pending steps > 6, warn once:
> "⚠️ This plan has N pending steps. Consider running steps 1–5 in this session, then opening a fresh session for the remainder."

**Session step counter**: count existing `[x]` checkboxes → store as `baseline_completed`. Check for `## Context` section → store as `has_analysis_context`.

After each Step 5 check-off, re-read the file and count total `[x]` checkboxes. `session_steps = current_completed − baseline_completed`.

**Pause trigger**:
```
threshold = 3 if has_analysis_context else 5
session_steps >= threshold AND (session_steps − threshold) % 3 == 0
```

When triggered, pause and prompt:
```
⚠️ [N] steps completed this session — context may be getting heavy.

Resume command: execute plan from .claude/b-plans/[plan-file].md

Choose:
  1 — Compact session now, then paste the resume command above to continue
  2 — Continue anyway (I'm tracking context myself)
```
Do not proceed until user replies with `1` or `2`.

### Step 2 — Parse plan structure and extract step checkboxes

Extract all lines matching:
- `- [ ] N. [description]` or `- [x] N. [description]`
- `- [ ] Step N — [description]` or `- [x] Step N — [description]`
- `- [❌] N. [description]` (failed state)

Build state map: `{step_number: {description, status: "pending" | "completed" | "failed"}}`.

### Step 3 — Display current state and next action

Show:
- Plan title and summary
- Completed steps (✓), failed steps (❌ — show prominently), pending steps (○)
- Next step to run

**Skill routing** — match keywords in next step's description (check top-to-bottom, stop at first match):

| Priority | Keyword(s) | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (first) | "delete", "remove", "config", "migrate", "migration", "document", "update docs", "rename", "move" | Manual step — instruct user, wait for `done` signal |
| 2 | "test", "validate", "quality", "lint", "check quality" | `@b-gate` |
| 3 | "review", "verify logic", "requirements coverage" | `@b-review` |
| 4 | "commit", "PR description", "push" | `@b-commit` |
| 5 (last) | "implement", "write", "code", "add", "create", "refactor", "build", "extend" | `@b-tdd` |
| — | (no match) | Ask: "Which skill for this step? (b-tdd / b-gate / b-review / b-commit / manual)" |

**Invocation format per subagent:**
- `@b-tdd [plan-file]:[N]` — must run exactly step N
- `@b-gate` — no args (or `src/ path/` to scope)
- `@b-review [plan-file]` — no step number
- `@b-commit` — no args

Show routing decision and invoke immediately (no confirmation for unambiguous keyword-matched routes):
```
→ Invoking Step N — [description] via @b-[skill] (keyword match: '[keyword]')
```

**Dependency blocking**: if a prerequisite step M is `[❌]`:
```
⛔ Step N depends on Step M which failed. Resolve Step M before continuing, or type `override` to bypass.
```

**Failed step handling**: if next step has `failed` status:
```
⚠️ Step N previously failed: [reason]. Retry or skip?
- Retry: run @b-[skill] .claude/b-plans/[file].md:N
- Skip: type `skip` to leave as-is and advance
```

### Step 4 — Invoke subagent and detect outcome

Invoke the subagent using the format from Step 3. Interpret output for success or failure:

- `@b-tdd`: all tests pass and implementation complete
- `@b-gate`: all checks pass (no lint errors, no typecheck failures, all tests green)
- `@b-review`: "READY FOR PR" → auto-advance; "NEEDS FIXES" → write feedback to `## Review Feedback` section, pause
- `@b-commit`: commit message generated
- **Priority 1 (manual step)**: instruct user, wait for `done`/`next`/`continue` signal

**On success**: auto-advance to Step 5 without waiting for user input.
**On failure**: pause and invoke failure handling below.

**b-gate failure shortcut**: if b-gate fails:
1. Extract failing check name and first ~10 lines of error output.
2. Write error to `## Last Gate Failure` section in plan file.
3. Offer:
   ```
   ⚠️ b-gate failed: [failing-check]
   [first ~10 lines of error output]

   Options:
     1 — Auto-launch @b-debug with this error (faster root cause analysis)
     2 — Fix manually (I'll investigate myself)
   ```
4. If user picks `1`: invoke `@b-debug [key error lines]`. Wait for completion, then re-invoke `@b-gate`. If passes, auto-advance to Step 5.

**Failure handling**: if skill output signals failure:
1. Ask user for a brief reason (one sentence).
2. Edit plan file: write `- [❌] N — [brief reason]` replacing `- [ ]` for the current step.
3. Run `git diff HEAD --stat`. If output shows modified files, present rollback option:
   > "Step N left uncommitted changes. Roll back to clean state before retrying? (`git checkout -- .` resets modified tracked files to last commit.)"
   - If user confirms: instruct them to run `git checkout -- .`, confirm repo is clean before retrying.
   - If user declines: note partial state explicitly.
4. Surface failure and halt until user resolves it or requests skip.

### Step 5 — Update plan state

Once step completes: edit the corresponding checkbox `- [ ]` → `- [x]`. Re-read the file after editing to recompute the session step counter.

### Step 6 — Loop or finish

Check if all steps in the pipeline are complete or skipped.
- If done: show summary, congratulate user, exit. Note any failed/skipped steps.
- If pending: increment to next step and return to Step 3.
- If all remaining steps are `failed`: surface blocked state to user — do not loop indefinitely.

**NEEDS FIXES re-entry path**: if b-review returns NEEDS FIXES and user signals code was changed:
1. Do NOT reset automatically — wait for user to signal a fix.
2. Run `git diff HEAD --stat` to verify actual file changes.
   - If empty: inform user "No code changes detected. Please modify and save files before re-entering b-gate."
   - If modified files exist: proceed to step 3.
3. Ask: "Did this fix add new behavior, or was it cosmetic (null check, rename, guard clause, typo)?"
   - **Cosmetic** → reset b-gate `[x]` to `[ ]`, re-route to `@b-gate`.
   - **New behavior** → route to `@b-tdd [plan-file]:[N]` for the affected step first. After b-tdd completes, reset b-gate `[x]` to `[ ]` and proceed through b-gate → b-review again.
4. Return to Step 3 with correct routing.

## Rules

- **Only update plan with user approval**: never auto-commit plan changes without explicit user signal (`done`, `next`).
- **Warn on skipped steps**: if user requests jumping to a later step, warn that earlier steps will be marked incomplete.
- **Preserve plan file integrity**: validate checkbox syntax before editing; skip malformed lines and log a warning.
- **Invocation format is subagent-specific**: `@b-tdd` gets `[plan-file]:[N]`; `@b-review` gets `[plan-file]`; `@b-gate` and `@b-commit` get no plan args.
- **Rollback on partial failure**: if a step fails after modifying files, always check `git diff HEAD --stat` and offer `git checkout -- .` before retry.
- **NEEDS FIXES requires git evidence**: reset b-gate checkpoint only after `git diff HEAD --stat` confirms actual file changes.
- **Auto-advance on success**: only pause for user input on: failure, ambiguous routing, manual steps, NEEDS FIXES from b-review, or session step threshold.
- **Never autonomously trigger destructive git commands** — no `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset --hard`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, or `git branch -D`. Rollback (`git checkout -- .`) must be offered to user, never auto-executed. Commits are always delegated to `@b-commit`.
