  Aggregate and summarize today's top tech news from curated sources into a grouped digest.
  ALWAYS use when the user says "tin tức hôm nay", "news hôm nay", "có gì mới hôm nay",
  "tech news", "b-news", "điểm tin", or asks what's happening in tech today.
  Trigger even for short queries like "hôm nay có gì mới không".

# b-news

Aggregates today's top tech news from curated sources using Brave Search,
then groups stories by topic into a clean bilingual daily digest.

## Tools required

- `brave_news_search` — from `brave-search` MCP server (required)
- `firecrawl_scrape` — from `firecrawl` MCP server (optional, for detail on demand)

If `brave-search` is unavailable, stop and tell the user:
"❌ brave-search MCP is not connected. Please check `/mcp`."

Graceful degradation: ❌ Not possible — this skill requires live web data. If the MCP is unavailable, stop and tell the user.

## Curated sources

Results from these domains are preferred over generic tech blogs:

| Source | Domain | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| Ars Technica | arstechnica.com | Deep tech + science reporting |
| 9to5Google | 9to5google.com | Android, Google, Pixel |
| 9to5Mac | 9to5mac.com | Apple, iOS, Mac |
| 9to5Linux | 9to5linux.com | Linux, open source |
| BleepingComputer | bleepingcomputer.com | Security, malware, CVEs |
| The Register | theregister.com | Enterprise tech |
| How-To Geek | howtogeek.com | Software, Windows, tools |
| Hacker News | news.ycombinator.com | Community top stories |

## Steps

### Step 1 — Search by topic category

**Before running the 5 default searches**: check if the user mentioned a specific topic (e.g., 'news about React', 'AI news today', 'security breaches this week'). If yes: replace 1–2 of the 5 default queries with focused queries on that topic, keeping the rest as-is. Example: if user says 'AI news', replace Search 3 (`Apple Google Microsoft product`) with `'[specific AI topic] latest news [year]'`. If user made a generic request ('news today', 'điểm tin') → run the 5 default queries unchanged.

Run **5 searches in parallel** (single message, multiple tool calls), one per major topic area.
Use `brave_news_search` — it is designed for news with built-in freshness filtering.
Do NOT use `site:` or boolean `OR` operators, as these are unreliable in Brave Search MCP.

```
Search 1: "AI machine learning"
Search 2: "security vulnerability breach"
Search 3: "Apple Google Microsoft product"
Search 4: "Linux open source release"
Search 5: "developer tools programming"
```

- Use `brave_news_search` with `count: 5` and `freshness: "pd"` (past day) per search
- After getting results, prefer stories from the curated source list above
  over generic tech blogs — but do not discard good stories from other sources
- Collect: headline, URL, 1-sentence snippet per story

After collecting results: if total unique stories across all 5 searches is fewer than 10 → retry searches 1 and 2 (`AI machine learning`, `security vulnerability breach`) with `freshness: "pw"` (past week). Mark any stories from this retry with `(earlier this week)` in the output.

### Step 2 — Deduplicate and categorize

From all collected results (~25 stories), filter and group:

- **Discard**: duplicates covering the same event (keep the best source), opinion
  pieces, sponsored content, listicles ("10 best..."), and stories older than 48 hours
- **Group** into categories (omit any category with no stories):
  - 🤖 AI & Machine Learning
  - 🔒 Security & Privacy
  - 📱 Mobile & Devices
  - 💻 Software & Apps
  - 🐧 Linux & Open Source
  - 🏢 Big Tech
  - 📌 Other

Target: **3 stories per category max** — quality over quantity.

### Step 3 — Scrape for detail (on demand only)

Only if the user follows up with "đọc thêm về..." or "chi tiết về..." a specific story:
call `firecrawl_scrape` on that one URL. Do not bulk scrape during the initial digest.

## Output format

**Language detection**: Check the user's query language before formatting output.
- Vietnamese query ("tin tức", "điểm tin", "hôm nay có gì mới") → bilingual output (English headline + Vietnamese translation)
- English query ("tech news", "news today", "what's new") → English-only output (skip Vietnamese translations)
- Ambiguous or mixed → default to bilingual

### Bilingual output (Vietnamese query)

```
# 📰 Tech News — [Today's Date]

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning

**[English Headline]**
[1-sentence English summary] — ([Source Name](URL))
> [Tiêu đề tiếng Việt] — [1 câu tóm tắt tiếng Việt]

[... remaining categories ...]

---
*[N] stories · Sources searched: Ars Technica, 9to5Google, 9to5Mac, BleepingComputer,
The Register, 9to5Linux, How-To Geek, Hacker News*
```

### English-only output (English query)

```
# 📰 Tech News — [Today's Date]

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning

**[English Headline]**
[1-sentence English summary] — ([Source Name](URL))

[... remaining categories ...]

## Rules

- Always include today's actual date in the header
- Always run all 5 `brave_news_search` calls in parallel — never sequentially
- Never use `site:` operator or boolean `OR` in queries — use topic keywords instead
- Max 3 stories per category — cut the weakest stories if more are found
- Omit any category with no stories rather than padding with weak content
- Do not scrape during digest generation — search snippets are sufficient for summaries
- Vietnamese translations should be natural, not literal word-for-word
